      .. versionadded:: 3.11

   .. method:: __len__(self):

      Returns number of members in flag::

         >>> len(Color.GREEN)
         1
         >>> len(white)
         3

      .. versionadded:: 3.11

   .. method:: __bool__(self):

      Returns *True* if any members in flag, *False* otherwise::

         >>> bool(Color.GREEN)
         True
         >>> bool(white)
         True
         >>> black = Color(0)
         >>> bool(black)
         False

   .. method:: __or__(self, other)

      Returns current flag binary or'ed with other::

         >>> Color.RED | Color.GREEN
         <Color.RED|GREEN: 3>

   .. method:: __and__(self, other)

      Returns current flag binary and'ed with other::

         >>> purple & white
         <Color.RED|BLUE: 5>
         >>> purple & Color.GREEN
         <Color: 0>

   .. method:: __xor__(self, other)

      Returns current flag binary xor'ed with other::

         >>> purple ^ white
         <Color.GREEN: 2>
         >>> purple ^ Color.GREEN
         <Color.RED|GREEN|BLUE: 7>

   .. method:: __invert__(self):

      Returns all the flags in *type(self)* that are not in *self*::

         >>> ~white
         <Color: 0>
         >>> ~purple
         <Color.GREEN: 2>
         >>> ~Color.RED
         <Color.GREEN|BLUE: 6>

   .. method:: _numeric_repr_

      Function used to format any remaining unnamed numeric values.  Default is
      the value's repr; common choices are :func:`hex` and :func:`oct`.

   .. note::

      Using :class:`auto` with :class:`Flag` results in integers that are powers
      of two, starting with ``1``.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11 The *repr()* of zero-valued flags has changed.  It
      is now:

         >>> Color(0) # doctest: +SKIP
         <Color: 0>

.. class:: IntFlag

   ``IntFlag`` is the same as :class:`Flag`, but its members are also integers and can be
   used anywhere that an integer can be used.

      >>> from enum import IntFlag, auto
      >>> class Color(IntFlag):
      ...     RED = auto()
      ...     GREEN = auto()
      ...     BLUE = auto()
      ...
      >>> Color.RED & 2
      <Color: 0>
      >>> Color.RED | 2
      <Color.RED|GREEN: 3>

   If any integer operation is performed with an *IntFlag* member, the result is
   not an *IntFlag*::

        >>> Color.RED + 2
        3

   If a :class:`Flag` operation is performed with an *IntFlag* member and:

   * the result is a valid *IntFlag*: an *IntFlag* is returned
   * the result is not a valid *IntFlag*: the result depends on the :class:`FlagBoundary` setting

   The :func:`repr` of unnamed zero-valued flags has changed.  It is now:

      >>> Color(0)
      <Color: 0>

   .. note::

      Using :class:`auto` with :class:`IntFlag` results in integers that are powers
      of two, starting with ``1``.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11

      :meth:`~object.__str__` is now :meth:`!int.__str__` to better support the
      *replacement of existing constants* use-case.  :meth:`~object.__format__` was
      already :meth:`!int.__format__` for that same reason.

      Inversion of an :class:`!IntFlag` now returns a positive value that is the
      union of all flags not in the given flag, rather than a negative value.
      This matches the existing :class:`Flag` behavior.

.. class:: ReprEnum

   :class:`!ReprEnum` uses the :meth:`repr() <Enum.__repr__>` of :class:`Enum`,
   but the :class:`str() <str>` of the mixed-in data type:

   * :meth:`!int.__str__` for :class:`IntEnum` and :class:`IntFlag`
   * :meth:`!str.__str__` for :class:`StrEnum`

   Inherit from :class:`!ReprEnum` to keep the :class:`str() <str>` / :func:`format`
   of the mixed-in data type instead of using the
   :class:`Enum`-default :meth:`str() <Enum.__str__>`.


   .. versionadded:: 3.11

.. class:: EnumCheck

   *EnumCheck* contains the options used by the :func:`verify` decorator to ensure
   various constraints; failed constraints result in a :exc:`ValueError`.

   .. attribute:: UNIQUE

      Ensure that each value has only one name::

         >>> from enum import Enum, verify, UNIQUE
         >>> @verify(UNIQUE)
         ... class Color(Enum):
         ...     RED = 1
         ...     GREEN = 2
         ...     BLUE = 3
         ...     CRIMSON = 1
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         ValueError: aliases found in <enum 'Color'>: CRIMSON -> RED


   .. attribute:: CONTINUOUS

      Ensure that there are no missing values between the lowest-valued member
      and the highest-valued member::

         >>> from enum import Enum, verify, CONTINUOUS
         >>> @verify(CONTINUOUS)
         ... class Color(Enum):
         ...     RED = 1
         ...     GREEN = 2
         ...     BLUE = 5
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         ValueError: invalid enum 'Color': missing values 3, 4

   .. attribute:: NAMED_FLAGS

      Ensure that any flag groups/masks contain only named flags -- useful when
      values are specified instead of being generated by :func:`auto`::

         >>> from enum import Flag, verify, NAMED_FLAGS
         >>> @verify(NAMED_FLAGS)
         ... class Color(Flag):
         ...     RED = 1
         ...     GREEN = 2
         ...     BLUE = 4
         ...     WHITE = 15
         ...     NEON = 31
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         ValueError: invalid Flag 'Color': aliases WHITE and NEON are missing combined values of 0x18 [use enum.show_flag_values(value) for details]

   .. note::

      CONTINUOUS and NAMED_FLAGS are designed to work with integer-valued members.

   .. versionadded:: 3.11

.. class:: FlagBoundary

   ``FlagBoundary`` controls how out-of-range values are handled in :class:`Flag` and its
   subclasses.

   .. attribute:: STRICT

      Out-of-range values cause a :exc:`ValueError` to be raised. This is the
      default for :class:`Flag`::

         >>> from enum import Flag, STRICT, auto
         >>> class StrictFlag(Flag, boundary=STRICT):
         ...     RED = auto()
         ...     GREEN = auto()
         ...     BLUE = auto()
         ...
         >>> StrictFlag(2**2 + 2**4)
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         ValueError: <flag 'StrictFlag'> invalid value 20
             given 0b0 10100
           allowed 0b0 00111

   .. attribute:: CONFORM

      Out-of-range values have invalid values removed, leaving a valid :class:`Flag`
      value::

         >>> from enum import Flag, CONFORM, auto
         >>> class ConformFlag(Flag, boundary=CONFORM):
         ...     RED = auto()
         ...     GREEN = auto()
         ...     BLUE = auto()
         ...
         >>> ConformFlag(2**2 + 2**4)
         <ConformFlag.BLUE: 4>

   .. attribute:: EJECT

      Out-of-range values lose their :class:`Flag` membership and revert to :class:`int`.

         >>> from enum import Flag, EJECT, auto
         >>> class EjectFlag(Flag, boundary=EJECT):
         ...     RED = auto()
         ...     GREEN = auto()
         ...     BLUE = auto()
         ...
         >>> EjectFlag(2**2 + 2**4)
         20

   .. attribute:: KEEP

      Out-of-range values are kept, and the :class:`Flag` membership is kept.
      This is the default for :class:`IntFlag`::

         >>> from enum import Flag, KEEP, auto
         >>> class KeepFlag(Flag, boundary=KEEP):
         ...     RED = auto()
         ...     GREEN = auto()
         ...     BLUE = auto()
         ...
         >>> KeepFlag(2**2 + 2**4)
         <KeepFlag.BLUE|16: 20>

   .. versionadded:: 3.11

.. class:: EnumDict

   *EnumDict* is a subclass of :class:`dict` that is used as the namespace
   for defining enum classes (see :ref:`prepare`).
   It is exposed to allow subclasses of :class:`EnumType` with advanced
   behavior like having multiple values per member.
   It should be called with the name of the enum class being created, otherwise
   private names and internal classes will not be handled correctly.

   Note that only the :class:`~collections.abc.MutableMapping` interface
   (:meth:`~object.__setitem__` and :meth:`~dict.update`) is overridden.
   It may be possible to bypass the checks using other :class:`!dict`
   operations like :meth:`|= <object.__ior__>`.

   .. attribute:: EnumDict.member_names

      A list of member names.

   .. versionadded:: 3.13

---------------

Supported ``__dunder__`` names
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:attr:`~EnumType.__members__` is a read-only ordered mapping of ``member_name``:``member``
items.  It is only available on the class.

:meth:`~Enum.__new__`, if specified, must create and return the enum members;
it is also a very good idea to set the member's :attr:`!_value_` appropriately.
Once all the members are created it is no longer used.


Supported ``_sunder_`` names
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- :meth:`~EnumType._add_alias_` -- adds a new name as an alias to an existing
  member.
- :meth:`~EnumType._add_value_alias_` -- adds a new value as an alias to an
  existing member.
- :attr:`~Enum._name_` -- name of the member
- :attr:`~Enum._value_` -- value of the member; can be set in ``__new__``
- :meth:`~Enum._missing_` -- a lookup function used when a value is not found;
  may be overridden
- :attr:`~Enum._ignore_` -- a list of names, either as a :class:`list` or a
  :class:`str`, that will not be transformed into members, and will be removed
  from the final class
- :attr:`~Enum._order_` -- no longer used, kept for backward
  compatibility (class attribute, removed during class creation)
- :meth:`~Enum._generate_next_value_` -- used to get an appropriate value for
  an enum member; may be overridden

  .. note::

     For standard :class:`Enum` classes the next value chosen is the highest
     value seen incremented by one.

     For :class:`Flag` classes the next value chosen will be the next highest
     power-of-two.

- While ``_sunder_`` names are generally reserved for the further development
  of the :class:`Enum` class and can not be used, some are explicitly allowed:

  - ``_repr_*`` (e.g. ``_repr_html_``), as used in `IPython's rich display`_

.. versionadded:: 3.6 ``_missing_``, ``_order_``, ``_generate_next_value_``
.. versionadded:: 3.7 ``_ignore_``

Utilities and Decorators
------------------------

.. class:: auto

   *auto* can be used in place of a value.  If used, the *Enum* machinery will
   call an :class:`Enum`'s :meth:`~Enum._generate_next_value_` to get an appropriate value.
   For :class:`Enum` and :class:`IntEnum` that appropriate value will be the last value plus
   one; for :class:`Flag` and :class:`IntFlag` it will be the first power-of-two greater
   than the highest value; for :class:`StrEnum` it will be the lower-cased version of
   the member's name.  Care must be taken if mixing *auto()* with manually
   specified values.

   *auto* instances are only resolved when at the top level of an assignment:

   * ``FIRST = auto()`` will work (auto() is replaced with ``1``);
   * ``SECOND = auto(), -2`` will work (auto is replaced with ``2``, so ``2, -2`` is
     used to create the ``SECOND`` enum member;
   * ``THREE = [auto(), -3]`` will *not* work (``<auto instance>, -3`` is used to
     create the ``THREE`` enum member)

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11.1

      In prior versions, ``auto()`` had to be the only thing
      on the assignment line to work properly.

   ``_generate_next_value_`` can be overridden to customize the values used by
   *auto*.

   .. note:: in 3.13 the default ``_generate_next_value_`` will always return
             the highest member value incremented by 1, and will fail if any
             member is an incompatible type.

.. decorator:: property

   A decorator similar to the built-in *property*, but specifically for
   enumerations.  It allows member attributes to have the same names as members
   themselves.

   .. note:: the *property* and the member must be defined in separate classes;
             for example, the *value* and *name* attributes are defined in the
             *Enum* class, and *Enum* subclasses can define members with the
             names ``value`` and ``name``.

   .. versionadded:: 3.11

.. decorator:: unique

   A :keyword:`class` decorator specifically for enumerations.  It searches an
   enumeration's :attr:`~EnumType.__members__`, gathering any aliases it finds; if any are
   found :exc:`ValueError` is raised with the details::

      >>> from enum import Enum, unique
      >>> @unique
      ... class Mistake(Enum):
      ...     ONE = 1
      ...     TWO = 2
      ...     THREE = 3
      ...     FOUR = 3
      ...
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
      ValueError: duplicate values found in <enum 'Mistake'>: FOUR -> THREE

.. decorator:: verify

   A :keyword:`class` decorator specifically for enumerations.  Members from
   :class:`EnumCheck` are used to specify which constraints should be checked
   on the decorated enumeration.

   .. versionadded:: 3.11

.. decorator:: member

   A decorator for use in enums: its target will become a member.

   .. versionadded:: 3.11

.. decorator:: nonmember

   A decorator for use in enums: its target will not become a member.

   .. versionadded:: 3.11

.. decorator:: global_enum

   A decorator to change the :class:`str() <str>` and :func:`repr` of an enum
   to show its members as belonging to the module instead of its class.
   Should only be used when the enum members are exported
   to the module global namespace (see :class:`re.RegexFlag` for an example).


   .. versionadded:: 3.11

.. function:: show_flag_values(value)

   Return a list of all power-of-two integers contained in a flag *value*.

   .. versionadded:: 3.11

---------------

Notes
-----

:class:`IntEnum`, :class:`StrEnum`, and :class:`IntFlag`

   These three enum types are designed to be drop-in replacements for existing
   integer- and string-based values; as such, they have extra limitations:

   - ``__str__`` uses the value and not the name of the enum member

   - ``__format__``, because it uses ``__str__``, will also use the value of
     the enum member instead of its name

   If you do not need/want those limitations, you can either create your own
   base class by mixing in the ``int`` or ``str`` type yourself::

       >>> from enum import Enum
       >>> class MyIntEnum(int, Enum):
       ...     pass

   or you can reassign the appropriate :meth:`str`, etc., in your enum::

       >>> from enum import Enum, IntEnum
       >>> class MyIntEnum(IntEnum):
       ...     __str__ = Enum.__str__

File: /Doc/library/errno.rst
================================================
:mod:`!errno` --- Standard errno system symbols
===============================================

.. module:: errno
   :synopsis: Standard errno system symbols.

----------------

This module makes available standard ``errno`` system symbols. The value of each
symbol is the corresponding integer value. The names and descriptions are
borrowed from :file:`linux/include/errno.h`, which should be
all-inclusive.


.. data:: errorcode

   Dictionary providing a mapping from the errno value to the string name in the
   underlying system.  For instance, ``errno.errorcode[errno.EPERM]`` maps to
   ``'EPERM'``.

To translate a numeric error code to an error message, use :func:`os.strerror`.

Of the following list, symbols that are not used on the current platform are not
defined by the module.  The specific list of defined symbols is available as
``errno.errorcode.keys()``.  Symbols available can include:


.. data:: EPERM

   Operation not permitted. This error is mapped to the exception
   :exc:`PermissionError`.


.. data:: ENOENT

   No such file or directory. This error is mapped to the exception
   :exc:`FileNotFoundError`.

Built-in Exceptions
===================

.. index::
   pair: statement; try
   pair: statement; except

In Python, all exceptions must be instances of a class that derives from
:class:`BaseException`.  In a :keyword:`try` statement with an :keyword:`except`
clause that mentions a particular class, that clause also handles any exception
classes derived from that class (but not exception classes from which *it* is
derived).  Two exception classes that are not related via subclassing are never
equivalent, even if they have the same name.

.. index:: pair: statement; raise

The built-in exceptions listed in this chapter can be generated by the interpreter or
built-in functions.  Except where mentioned, they have an "associated value"
indicating the detailed cause of the error.  This may be a string or a tuple of
several items of information (e.g., an error code and a string explaining the
code).  The associated value is usually passed as arguments to the exception
class's constructor.

User code can raise built-in exceptions.  This can be used to test an exception
handler or to report an error condition "just like" the situation in which the
interpreter raises the same exception; but beware that there is nothing to
prevent user code from raising an inappropriate error.

The built-in exception classes can be subclassed to define new exceptions;
programmers are encouraged to derive new exceptions from the :exc:`Exception`
class or one of its subclasses, and not from :exc:`BaseException`.  More
information on defining exceptions is available in the Python Tutorial under
:ref:`tut-userexceptions`.


Exception context
-----------------

.. index:: pair: exception; chaining
           __cause__ (exception attribute)
           __context__ (exception attribute)
           __suppress_context__ (exception attribute)

Three attributes on exception objects provide information about the context in
which the exception was raised:

.. attribute:: BaseException.__context__
               BaseException.__cause__
               BaseException.__suppress_context__

   When raising a new exception while another exception
   is already being handled, the new exception's
   :attr:`!__context__` attribute is automatically set to the handled
   exception.  An exception may be handled when an :keyword:`except` or
   :keyword:`finally` clause, or a :keyword:`with` statement, is used.

   This implicit exception context can be
   supplemented with an explicit cause by using :keyword:`!from` with
   :keyword:`raise`::

      raise new_exc from original_exc

   The expression following :keyword:`from<raise>` must be an exception or ``None``. It
   will be set as :attr:`!__cause__` on the raised exception. Setting
   :attr:`!__cause__` also implicitly sets the :attr:`!__suppress_context__`
   attribute to ``True``, so that using ``raise new_exc from None``
   effectively replaces the old exception with the new one for display
   purposes (e.g. converting :exc:`KeyError` to :exc:`AttributeError`), while
   leaving the old exception available in :attr:`!__context__` for introspection
   when debugging.

   The default traceback display code shows these chained exceptions in
   addition to the traceback for the exception itself. An explicitly chained
   exception in :attr:`!__cause__` is always shown when present. An implicitly
   chained exception in :attr:`!__context__` is shown only if :attr:`!__cause__`
   is :const:`None` and :attr:`!__suppress_context__` is false.

   In either case, the exception itself is always shown after any chained
   exceptions so that the final line of the traceback always shows the last
   exception that was raised.


Inheriting from built-in exceptions
-----------------------------------

User code can create subclasses that inherit from an exception type.
It's recommended to only subclass one exception type at a time to avoid
any possible conflicts between how the bases handle the ``args``
attribute, as well as due to possible memory layout incompatibilities.

.. impl-detail::

   Most built-in exceptions are implemented in C for efficiency, see:
   :source:`Objects/exceptions.c`.  Some have custom memory layouts
   which makes it impossible to create a subclass that inherits from
   multiple exception types. The memory layout of a type is an implementation
   detail and might change between Python versions, leading to new
   conflicts in the future.  Therefore, it's recommended to avoid
   subclassing multiple exception types altogether.


Base classes
------------

The following exceptions are used mostly as base classes for other exceptions.

.. exception:: BaseException

   The base class for all built-in exceptions.  It is not meant to be directly
   inherited by user-defined classes (for that, use :exc:`Exception`).  If
   :func:`str` is called on an instance of this class, the representation of
   the argument(s) to the instance are returned, or the empty string when
   there were no arguments.

   .. attribute:: args

      The tuple of arguments given to the exception constructor.  Some built-in
      exceptions (like :exc:`OSError`) expect a certain number of arguments and
      assign a special meaning to the elements of this tuple, while others are
      usually called only with a single string giving an error message.

   .. method:: with_traceback(tb)

      This method sets *tb* as the new traceback for the exception and returns
      the exception object.  It was more commonly used before the exception
      chaining features of :pep:`3134` became available.  The following example
      shows how we can convert an instance of ``SomeException`` into an
      instance of ``OtherException`` while preserving the traceback.  Once
      raised, the current frame is pushed onto the traceback of the
      ``OtherException``, as would have happened to the traceback of the
      original ``SomeException`` had we allowed it to propagate to the caller. ::

         try:
             ...
         except SomeException:
             tb = sys.exception().__traceback__
             raise OtherException(...).with_traceback(tb)

   .. attribute:: __traceback__

      A writable field that holds the
      :ref:`traceback object <traceback-objects>` associated with this
      exception. See also: :ref:`raise`.

   .. method:: add_note(note)

      Add the string ``note`` to the exception's notes which appear in the standard
      traceback after the exception string. A :exc:`TypeError` is raised if ``note``
      is not a string.

      .. versionadded:: 3.11

   .. attribute:: __notes__

      A list of the notes of this exception, which were added with :meth:`add_note`.
      This attribute is created when :meth:`add_note` is called.

      .. versionadded:: 3.11


.. exception:: Exception

   All built-in, non-system-exiting exceptions are derived from this class.  All
   user-defined exceptions should also be derived from this class.


.. exception:: ArithmeticError

   The base class for those built-in exceptions that are raised for various
   arithmetic errors: :exc:`OverflowError`, :exc:`ZeroDivisionError`,
   :exc:`FloatingPointError`.


.. exception:: BufferError

   Raised when a :ref:`buffer <bufferobjects>` related operation cannot be
   performed.


.. exception:: LookupError

   The base class for the exceptions that are raised when a key or index used on
   a mapping or sequence is invalid: :exc:`IndexError`, :exc:`KeyError`.  This
   can be raised directly by :func:`codecs.lookup`.


Concrete exceptions
-------------------

The following exceptions are the exceptions that are usually raised.

.. exception:: AssertionError

   .. index:: pair: statement; assert

   Raised when an :keyword:`assert` statement fails.


.. exception:: AttributeError

   Raised when an attribute reference (see :ref:`attribute-references`) or
   assignment fails.  (When an object does not support attribute references or
   attribute assignments at all, :exc:`TypeError` is raised.)

   The :attr:`name` and :attr:`obj` attributes can be set using keyword-only
   arguments to the constructor. When set they represent the name of the attribute
   that was attempted to be accessed and the object that was accessed for said
   attribute, respectively.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10
      Added the :attr:`name` and :attr:`obj` attributes.

.. exception:: EOFError

   Raised when the :func:`input` function hits an end-of-file condition (EOF)
   without reading any data. (N.B.: the :meth:`io.IOBase.read` and
   :meth:`io.IOBase.readline` methods return an empty string when they hit EOF.)


.. exception:: FloatingPointError

   Not currently used.


.. exception:: GeneratorExit

   Raised when a :term:`generator` or :term:`coroutine` is closed;
   see :meth:`generator.close` and :meth:`coroutine.close`.  It
   directly inherits from :exc:`BaseException` instead of :exc:`Exception` since
   it is technically not an error.


.. exception:: ImportError

   Raised when the :keyword:`import` statement has troubles trying to
   load a module.  Also raised when the "from list" in ``from ... import``
   has a name that cannot be found.

   The optional *name* and *path* keyword-only arguments
   set the corresponding attributes:

   .. attribute:: name

      The name of the module that was attempted to be imported.

   .. attribute:: path

      The path to any file which triggered the exception.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      Added the :attr:`name` and :attr:`path` attributes.

.. exception:: ModuleNotFoundError

   A subclass of :exc:`ImportError` which is raised by :keyword:`import`
   when a module could not be located.  It is also raised when ``None``
   is found in :data:`sys.modules`.

   .. versionadded:: 3.6


.. exception:: IndexError

   Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range.  (Slice indices are
   silently truncated to fall in the allowed range; if an index is not an
   integer, :exc:`TypeError` is raised.)

   .. XXX xref to sequences


.. exception:: KeyError

   Raised when a mapping (dictionary) key is not found in the set of existing keys.

   .. XXX xref to mapping objects?


.. exception:: KeyboardInterrupt

   Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (normally :kbd:`Control-C` or
   :kbd:`Delete`).  During execution, a check for interrupts is made
   regularly. The exception inherits from :exc:`BaseException` so as to not be
   accidentally caught by code that catches :exc:`Exception` and thus prevent
   the interpreter from exiting.

   .. note::

      Catching a :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` requires special consideration.
      Because it can be raised at unpredictable points, it may, in some
      circumstances, leave the running program in an inconsistent state. It is
      generally best to allow :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` to end the program as
      quickly as possible or avoid raising it entirely. (See
      :ref:`handlers-and-exceptions`.)


.. exception:: MemoryError

   Raised when an operation runs out of memory but the situation may still be
   rescued (by deleting some objects).  The associated value is a string indicating
   what kind of (internal) operation ran out of memory. Note that because of the
   underlying memory management architecture (C's :c:func:`malloc` function), the
   interpreter may not always be able to completely recover from this situation; it
   nevertheless raises an exception so that a stack traceback can be printed, in
   case a run-away program was the cause.


.. exception:: NameError

   Raised when a local or global name is not found.  This applies only to
   unqualified names.  The associated value is an error message that includes the
   name that could not be found.

   The :attr:`name` attribute can be set using a keyword-only argument to the
   constructor. When set it represent the name of the variable that was attempted
   to be accessed.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10
      Added the :attr:`name` attribute.


.. exception:: NotImplementedError

   This exception is derived from :exc:`RuntimeError`.  In user defined base
   classes, abstract methods should raise this exception when they require
   derived classes to override the method, or while the class is being
   developed to indicate that the real implementation still needs to be added.

   .. note::

      It should not be used to indicate that an operator or method is not
      meant to be supported at all -- in that case either leave the operator /
      method undefined or, if a subclass, set it to :data:`None`.

   .. note::

      ``NotImplementedError`` and :data:`NotImplemented` are not interchangeable,
      even though they have similar names and purposes.  See
      :data:`!NotImplemented` for details on when to use it.

.. exception:: OSError([arg])
               OSError(errno, strerror[, filename[, winerror[, filename2]]])

   .. index:: pair: module; errno

   This exception is raised when a system function returns a system-related
   error, including I/O failures such as "file not found" or "disk full"
   (not for illegal argument types or other incidental errors).

   The second form of the constructor sets the corresponding attributes,
   described below.  The attributes default to :const:`None` if not
   specified.  For backwards compatibility, if three arguments are passed,
   the :attr:`~BaseException.args` attribute contains only a 2-tuple
   of the first two constructor arguments.

   The constructor often actually returns a subclass of :exc:`OSError`, as
   described in `OS exceptions`_ below.  The particular subclass depends on
   the final :attr:`.errno` value.  This behaviour only occurs when
   constructing :exc:`OSError` directly or via an alias, and is not
   inherited when subclassing.

   .. attribute:: errno

      A numeric error code from the C variable :c:data:`errno`.

   .. attribute:: winerror

      Under Windows, this gives you the native
      Windows error code.  The :attr:`.errno` attribute is then an approximate
      translation, in POSIX terms, of that native error code.

      Under Windows, if the *winerror* constructor argument is an integer,
      the :attr:`.errno` attribute is determined from the Windows error code,
      and the *errno* argument is ignored.  On other platforms, the
      *winerror* argument is ignored, and the :attr:`winerror` attribute
      does not exist.

   .. attribute:: strerror

      The corresponding error message, as provided by
      the operating system.  It is formatted by the C
      functions :c:func:`perror` under POSIX, and :c:func:`FormatMessage`
      under Windows.

   .. attribute:: filename
                  filename2

      For exceptions that involve a file system path (such as :func:`open` or
      :func:`os.unlink`), :attr:`filename` is the file name passed to the function.
      For functions that involve two file system paths (such as
      :func:`os.rename`), :attr:`filename2` corresponds to the second
      file name passed to the function.


   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      :exc:`EnvironmentError`, :exc:`IOError`, :exc:`WindowsError`,
      :exc:`socket.error`, :exc:`select.error` and
      :exc:`mmap.error` have been merged into :exc:`OSError`, and the
      constructor may return a subclass.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      The :attr:`filename` attribute is now the original file name passed to
      the function, instead of the name encoded to or decoded from the
      :term:`filesystem encoding and error handler`. Also, the *filename2*
      constructor argument and attribute was added.


.. exception:: OverflowError

   Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be
   represented.  This cannot occur for integers (which would rather raise
   :exc:`MemoryError` than give up).  However, for historical reasons,
   OverflowError is sometimes raised for integers that are outside a required
   range.   Because of the lack of standardization of floating-point exception
   handling in C, most floating-point operations are not checked.


.. exception:: PythonFinalizationError

   This exception is derived from :exc:`RuntimeError`.  It is raised when
   an operation is blocked during interpreter shutdown also known as
   :term:`Python finalization <interpreter shutdown>`.

   Examples of operations which can be blocked with a
   :exc:`PythonFinalizationError` during the Python finalization:

   * Creating a new Python thread.
   * :func:`os.fork`.

   See also the :func:`sys.is_finalizing` function.

   .. versionadded:: 3.13
      Previously, a plain :exc:`RuntimeError` was raised.


.. exception:: RecursionError

   This exception is derived from :exc:`RuntimeError`.  It is raised when the
   interpreter detects that the maximum recursion depth (see
   :func:`sys.getrecursionlimit`) is exceeded.

   .. versionadded:: 3.5
      Previously, a plain :exc:`RuntimeError` was raised.


.. exception:: ReferenceError

   This exception is raised when a weak reference proxy, created by the
   :func:`weakref.proxy` function, is used to access an attribute of the referent
   after it has been garbage collected. For more information on weak references,
   see the :mod:`weakref` module.


.. exception:: RuntimeError

   Raised when an error is detected that doesn't fall in any of the other
   categories.  The associated value is a string indicating what precisely went
   wrong.


.. exception:: StopIteration

   Raised by built-in function :func:`next` and an :term:`iterator`\'s
   :meth:`~iterator.__next__` method to signal that there are no further
   items produced by the iterator.

   .. attribute:: StopIteration.value

      The exception object has a single attribute :attr:`!value`, which is
      given as an argument when constructing the exception, and defaults
      to :const:`None`.

   When a :term:`generator` or :term:`coroutine` function
   returns, a new :exc:`StopIteration` instance is
   raised, and the value returned by the function is used as the
   :attr:`value` parameter to the constructor of the exception.

   If a generator code directly or indirectly raises :exc:`StopIteration`,
   it is converted into a :exc:`RuntimeError` (retaining the
   :exc:`StopIteration` as the new exception's cause).

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      Added ``value`` attribute and the ability for generator functions to
      use it to return a value.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Introduced the RuntimeError transformation via
      ``from __future__ import generator_stop``, see :pep:`479`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.7
      Enable :pep:`479` for all code by default: a :exc:`StopIteration`
      error raised in a generator is transformed into a :exc:`RuntimeError`.

.. exception:: StopAsyncIteration

   Must be raised by :meth:`~object.__anext__` method of an
   :term:`asynchronous iterator` object to stop the iteration.

   .. versionadded:: 3.5

.. exception:: SyntaxError(message, details)

   Raised when the parser encounters a syntax error.  This may occur in an
   :keyword:`import` statement, in a call to the built-in functions
   :func:`compile`, :func:`exec`,
   or :func:`eval`, or when reading the initial script or standard input
   (also interactively).

   The :func:`str` of the exception instance returns only the error message.
   Details is a tuple whose members are also available as separate attributes.

   .. attribute:: filename

      The name of the file the syntax error occurred in.

   .. attribute:: lineno

      Which line number in the file the error occurred in. This is
      1-indexed: the first line in the file has a ``lineno`` of 1.

   .. attribute:: offset

      The column in the line where the error occurred. This is
      1-indexed: the first character in the line has an ``offset`` of 1.

   .. attribute:: text

      The source code text involved in the error.

   .. attribute:: end_lineno

      Which line number in the file the error occurred ends in. This is
      1-indexed: the first line in the file has a ``lineno`` of 1.

   .. attribute:: end_offset

      The column in the end line where the error occurred finishes. This is
      1-indexed: the first character in the line has an ``offset`` of 1.

   For errors in f-string fields, the message is prefixed by "f-string: "
   and the offsets are offsets in a text constructed from the replacement
   expression.  For example, compiling f'Bad {a b} field' results in this
   args attribute: ('f-string: ...', ('', 1, 2, '(a b)\n', 1, 5)).

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10
      Added the :attr:`end_lineno` and :attr:`end_offset` attributes.

.. exception:: IndentationError

   Base class for syntax errors related to incorrect indentation.  This is a
   subclass of :exc:`SyntaxError`.


.. exception:: TabError

   Raised when indentation contains an inconsistent use of tabs and spaces.
   This is a subclass of :exc:`IndentationError`.


.. exception:: SystemError

   Raised when the interpreter finds an internal error, but the situation does not
   look so serious to cause it to abandon all hope. The associated value is a
   string indicating what went wrong (in low-level terms).

   You should report this to the author or maintainer of your Python interpreter.
   Be sure to report the version of the Python interpreter (``sys.version``; it is
   also printed at the start of an interactive Python session), the exact error
   message (the exception's associated value) and if possible the source of the
   program that triggered the error.


.. exception:: SystemExit

   This exception is raised by the :func:`sys.exit` function.  It inherits from
   :exc:`BaseException` instead of :exc:`Exception` so that it is not accidentally
   caught by code that catches :exc:`Exception`.  This allows the exception to
   properly propagate up and cause the interpreter to exit.  When it is not
   handled, the Python interpreter exits; no stack traceback is printed.  The
   constructor accepts the same optional argument passed to :func:`sys.exit`.
   If the value is an integer, it specifies the system exit status (passed to
   C's :c:func:`exit` function); if it is ``None``, the exit status is zero; if
   it has another type (such as a string), the object's value is printed and
   the exit status is one.

   A call to :func:`sys.exit` is translated into an exception so that clean-up
   handlers (:keyword:`finally` clauses of :keyword:`try` statements) can be
   executed, and so that a debugger can execute a script without running the risk
   of losing control.  The :func:`os._exit` function can be used if it is
   absolutely positively necessary to exit immediately (for example, in the child
   process after a call to :func:`os.fork`).

   .. attribute:: code

      The exit status or error message that is passed to the constructor.
      (Defaults to ``None``.)


.. exception:: TypeError

   Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate
   type.  The associated value is a string giving details about the type mismatch.

   This exception may be raised by user code to indicate that an attempted
   operation on an object is not supported, and is not meant to be. If an object
   is meant to support a given operation but has not yet provided an
   implementation, :exc:`NotImplementedError` is the proper exception to raise.

   Passing arguments of the wrong type (e.g. passing a :class:`list` when an
   :class:`int` is expected) should result in a :exc:`TypeError`, but passing
   arguments with the wrong value (e.g. a number outside expected boundaries)
   should result in a :exc:`ValueError`.

.. exception:: UnboundLocalError

   Raised when a reference is made to a local variable in a function or method, but
   no value has been bound to that variable.  This is a subclass of
   :exc:`NameError`.


.. exception:: UnicodeError

   Raised when a Unicode-related encoding or decoding error occurs.  It is a
   subclass of :exc:`ValueError`.

   :exc:`UnicodeError` has attributes that describe the encoding or decoding
   error.  For example, ``err.object[err.start:err.end]`` gives the particular
   invalid input that the codec failed on.

   .. attribute:: encoding

       The name of the encoding that raised the error.

   .. attribute:: reason

       A string describing the specific codec error.

   .. attribute:: object

       The object the codec was attempting to encode or decode.

   .. attribute:: start

       The first index of invalid data in :attr:`object`.

       This value should not be negative as it is interpreted as an
       absolute offset but this constraint is not enforced at runtime.

   .. attribute:: end

       The index after the last invalid data in :attr:`object`.

       This value should not be negative as it is interpreted as an
       absolute offset but this constraint is not enforced at runtime.


.. exception:: UnicodeEncodeError

   Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during encoding.  It is a subclass of
   :exc:`UnicodeError`.


.. exception:: UnicodeDecodeError

   Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during decoding.  It is a subclass of
   :exc:`UnicodeError`.


.. exception:: UnicodeTranslateError

   Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during translating.  It is a subclass
   of :exc:`UnicodeError`.


.. exception:: ValueError

   Raised when an operation or function receives an argument that has the
   right type but an inappropriate value, and the situation is not described by a
   more precise exception such as :exc:`IndexError`.


.. exception:: ZeroDivisionError

   Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.  The
   associated value is a string indicating the type of the operands and the
   operation.


The following exceptions are kept for compatibility with previous versions;
starting from Python 3.3, they are aliases of :exc:`OSError`.

.. exception:: EnvironmentError

.. exception:: IOError

.. exception:: WindowsError

   Only available on Windows.


OS exceptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following exceptions are subclasses of :exc:`OSError`, they get raised
depending on the system error code.

.. exception:: BlockingIOError

   Raised when an operation would block on an object (e.g. socket) set
   for non-blocking operation.
   Corresponds to :c:data:`errno` :py:const:`~errno.EAGAIN`, :py:const:`~errno.EALREADY`,
   :py:const:`~errno.EWOULDBLOCK` and :py:const:`~errno.EINPROGRESS`.

   In addition to those of :exc:`OSError`, :exc:`BlockingIOError` can have
   one more attribute:

   .. attribute:: characters_written

      An integer containing the number of characters written to the stream
      before it blocked.  This attribute is available when using the
      buffered I/O classes from the :mod:`io` module.

.. exception:: ChildProcessError

   Raised when an operation on a child process failed.
   Corresponds to :c:data:`errno` :py:const:`~errno.ECHILD`.

.. exception:: ConnectionError

   A base class for connection-related issues.

   Subclasses are :exc:`BrokenPipeError`, :exc:`ConnectionAbortedError`,
   :exc:`ConnectionRefusedError` and :exc:`ConnectionResetError`.

.. exception:: BrokenPipeError

   A subclass of :exc:`ConnectionError`, raised when trying to write on a
   pipe while the other end has been closed, or trying to write on a socket
   which has been shutdown for writing.
   Corresponds to :c:data:`errno` :py:const:`~errno.EPIPE` and :py:const:`~errno.ESHUTDOWN`.

.. exception:: ConnectionAbortedError

   A subclass of :exc:`ConnectionError`, raised when a connection attempt
   is aborted by the peer.
   Corresponds to :c:data:`errno` :py:const:`~errno.ECONNABORTED`.

.. exception:: ConnectionRefusedError

   A subclass of :exc:`ConnectionError`, raised when a connection attempt
   is refused by the peer.
   Corresponds to :c:data:`errno` :py:const:`~errno.ECONNREFUSED`.

.. exception:: ConnectionResetError

   A subclass of :exc:`ConnectionError`, raised when a connection is
   reset by the peer.
   Corresponds to :c:data:`errno` :py:const:`~errno.ECONNRESET`.

.. exception:: FileExistsError

   Raised when trying to create a file or directory which already exists.
   Corresponds to :c:data:`errno` :py:const:`~errno.EEXIST`.

.. exception:: FileNotFoundError

   Raised when a file or directory is requested but doesn't exist.
   Corresponds to :c:data:`errno` :py:const:`~errno.ENOENT`.

.. exception:: InterruptedError

   Raised when a system call is interrupted by an incoming signal.
   Corresponds to :c:data:`errno` :py:const:`~errno.EINTR`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Python now retries system calls when a syscall is interrupted by a
      signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception (see :pep:`475`
      for the rationale), instead of raising :exc:`InterruptedError`.

.. exception:: IsADirectoryError

   Raised when a file operation (such as :func:`os.remove`) is requested
   on a directory.
   Corresponds to :c:data:`errno` :py:const:`~errno.EISDIR`.

.. exception:: NotADirectoryError

   Raised when a directory operation (such as :func:`os.listdir`) is requested on
   something which is not a directory.  On most POSIX platforms, it may also be
   raised if an operation attempts to open or traverse a non-directory file as if
   it were a directory.
   Corresponds to :c:data:`errno` :py:const:`~errno.ENOTDIR`.

.. exception:: PermissionError

   Raised when trying to run an operation without the adequate access
   rights - for example filesystem permissions.
   Corresponds to :c:data:`errno` :py:const:`~errno.EACCES`,
   :py:const:`~errno.EPERM`, and :py:const:`~errno.ENOTCAPABLE`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11.1
      WASI's :py:const:`~errno.ENOTCAPABLE` is now mapped to
      :exc:`PermissionError`.

.. exception:: ProcessLookupError

   Raised when a given process doesn't exist.
   Corresponds to :c:data:`errno` :py:const:`~errno.ESRCH`.

.. exception:: TimeoutError

   Raised when a system function timed out at the system level.
   Corresponds to :c:data:`errno` :py:const:`~errno.ETIMEDOUT`.

.. versionadded:: 3.3
   All the above :exc:`OSError` subclasses were added.

.. _warning-categories-as-exceptions:

Warnings
--------

The following exceptions are used as warning categories; see the
:ref:`warning-categories` documentation for more details.

.. exception:: Warning

   Base class for warning categories.


.. exception:: UserWarning

   Base class for warnings generated by user code.


.. exception:: DeprecationWarning

   Base class for warnings about deprecated features when those warnings are
   intended for other Python developers.

   Ignored by the default warning filters, except in the ``__main__`` module
   (:pep:`565`). Enabling the :ref:`Python Development Mode <devmode>` shows
   this warning.

   The deprecation policy is described in :pep:`387`.


.. exception:: PendingDeprecationWarning

   Base class for warnings about features which are obsolete and
   expected to be deprecated in the future, but are not deprecated
   at the moment.

   This class is rarely used as emitting a warning about a possible
   upcoming deprecation is unusual, and :exc:`DeprecationWarning`
   is preferred for already active deprecations.

   Ignored by the default warning filters. Enabling the :ref:`Python
   Development Mode <devmode>` shows this warning.

   The deprecation policy is described in :pep:`387`.


.. exception:: SyntaxWarning

   Base class for warnings about dubious syntax.


.. exception:: RuntimeWarning

   Base class for warnings about dubious runtime behavior.


.. exception:: FutureWarning

   Base class for warnings about deprecated features when those warnings are
   intended for end users of applications that are written in Python.


.. exception:: ImportWarning

   Base class for warnings about probable mistakes in module imports.

   Ignored by the default warning filters. Enabling the :ref:`Python
   Development Mode <devmode>` shows this warning.


.. exception:: UnicodeWarning

   Base class for warnings related to Unicode.


.. exception:: EncodingWarning

   Base class for warnings related to encodings.

   See :ref:`io-encoding-warning` for details.

   .. versionadded:: 3.10


.. exception:: BytesWarning

   Base class for warnings related to :class:`bytes` and :class:`bytearray`.


.. exception:: ResourceWarning

   Base class for warnings related to resource usage.

   Ignored by the default warning filters. Enabling the :ref:`Python
   Development Mode <devmode>` shows this warning.

   .. versionadded:: 3.2


.. _lib-exception-groups:

Exception groups
----------------

The following are used when it is necessary to raise multiple unrelated
exceptions. They are part of the exception hierarchy so they can be
handled with :keyword:`except` like all other exceptions. In addition,
they are recognised by :keyword:`except*<except_star>`, which matches
their subgroups based on the types of the contained exceptions.

.. exception:: ExceptionGroup(msg, excs)
.. exception:: BaseExceptionGroup(msg, excs)

   Both of these exception types wrap the exceptions in the sequence ``excs``.
   The ``msg`` parameter must be a string. The difference between the two
   classes is that :exc:`BaseExceptionGroup` extends :exc:`BaseException` and
   it can wrap any exception, while :exc:`ExceptionGroup` extends :exc:`Exception`
   and it can only wrap subclasses of :exc:`Exception`. This design is so that
   ``except Exception`` catches an :exc:`ExceptionGroup` but not
   :exc:`BaseExceptionGroup`.

   The :exc:`BaseExceptionGroup` constructor returns an :exc:`ExceptionGroup`
   rather than a :exc:`BaseExceptionGroup` if all contained exceptions are
   :exc:`Exception` instances, so it can be used to make the selection
   automatic. The :exc:`ExceptionGroup` constructor, on the other hand,
   raises a :exc:`TypeError` if any contained exception is not an
   :exc:`Exception` subclass.

   .. attribute:: message

       The ``msg`` argument to the constructor. This is a read-only attribute.

   .. attribute:: exceptions

       A tuple of the exceptions in the ``excs`` sequence given to the
       constructor. This is a read-only attribute.

   .. method:: subgroup(condition)

      Returns an exception group that contains only the exceptions from the
      current group that match *condition*, or ``None`` if the result is empty.

      The condition can be an exception type or tuple of exception types, in which
      case each exception is checked for a match using the same check that is used
      in an ``except`` clause.  The condition can also be a callable (other than
      a type object) that accepts an exception as its single argument and returns
      true for the exceptions that should be in the subgroup.

      The nesting structure of the current exception is preserved in the result,
      as are the values of its :attr:`message`,
      :attr:`~BaseException.__traceback__`, :attr:`~BaseException.__cause__`,
      :attr:`~BaseException.__context__` and
      :attr:`~BaseException.__notes__` fields.
      Empty nested groups are omitted from the result.

      The condition is checked for all exceptions in the nested exception group,
      including the top-level and any nested exception groups. If the condition is
      true for such an exception group, it is included in the result in full.

      .. versionadded:: 3.13
         ``condition`` can be any callable which is not a type object.

   .. method:: split(condition)

      Like :meth:`subgroup`, but returns the pair ``(match, rest)`` where ``match``
      is ``subgroup(condition)`` and ``rest`` is the remaining non-matching
      part.

   .. method:: derive(excs)

      Returns an exception group with the same :attr:`message`, but which
      wraps the exceptions in ``excs``.

      This method is used by :meth:`subgroup` and :meth:`split`, which
      are used in various contexts to break up an exception group. A
      subclass needs to override it in order to make :meth:`subgroup`
      and :meth:`split` return instances of the subclass rather
      than :exc:`ExceptionGroup`.

      :meth:`subgroup` and :meth:`split` copy the
      :attr:`~BaseException.__traceback__`,
      :attr:`~BaseException.__cause__`, :attr:`~BaseException.__context__` and
      :attr:`~BaseException.__notes__` fields from
      the original exception group to the one returned by :meth:`derive`, so
      these fields do not need to be updated by :meth:`derive`.

      .. doctest::

         >>> class MyGroup(ExceptionGroup):
         ...     def derive(self, excs):
         ...         return MyGroup(self.message, excs)
         ...
         >>> e = MyGroup("eg", [ValueError(1), TypeError(2)])
         >>> e.add_note("a note")
         >>> e.__context__ = Exception("context")
         >>> e.__cause__ = Exception("cause")
         >>> try:
         ...    raise e
         ... except Exception as e:
         ...    exc = e
         ...
         >>> match, rest = exc.split(ValueError)
         >>> exc, exc.__context__, exc.__cause__, exc.__notes__
         (MyGroup('eg', [ValueError(1), TypeError(2)]), Exception('context'), Exception('cause'), ['a note'])
         >>> match, match.__context__, match.__cause__, match.__notes__
         (MyGroup('eg', [ValueError(1)]), Exception('context'), Exception('cause'), ['a note'])
         >>> rest, rest.__context__, rest.__cause__, rest.__notes__
         (MyGroup('eg', [TypeError(2)]), Exception('context'), Exception('cause'), ['a note'])
         >>> exc.__traceback__ is match.__traceback__ is rest.__traceback__
         True


   Note that :exc:`BaseExceptionGroup` defines :meth:`~object.__new__`, so
   subclasses that need a different constructor signature need to
   override that rather than :meth:`~object.__init__`. For example, the following
   defines an exception group subclass which accepts an exit_code and
   and constructs the group's message from it. ::

      class Errors(ExceptionGroup):
         def __new__(cls, errors, exit_code):
            self = super().__new__(Errors, f"exit code: {exit_code}", errors)
            self.exit_code = exit_code
            return self

         def derive(self, excs):
            return Errors(excs, self.exit_code)

   Like :exc:`ExceptionGroup`, any subclass of :exc:`BaseExceptionGroup` which
   is also a subclass of :exc:`Exception` can only wrap instances of
   :exc:`Exception`.

Exception hierarchy
-------------------

The class hierarchy for built-in exceptions is:

.. literalinclude:: ../../Lib/test/exception_hierarchy.txt
  :language: text

File: /Doc/library/faulthandler.rst
================================================
:mod:`!faulthandler` --- Dump the Python traceback
==================================================

.. module:: faulthandler
   :synopsis: Dump the Python traceback.

.. versionadded:: 3.3

----------------

This module contains functions to dump Python tracebacks explicitly, on a fault,
after a timeout, or on a user signal. Call :func:`faulthandler.enable` to
install fault handlers for the :const:`~signal.SIGSEGV`,
:const:`~signal.SIGFPE`, :const:`~signal.SIGABRT`, :const:`~signal.SIGBUS`, and
:const:`~signal.SIGILL` signals. You can also
enable them at startup by setting the :envvar:`PYTHONFAULTHANDLER` environment
variable or by using the :option:`-X` ``faulthandler`` command line option.

The fault handler is compatible with system fault handlers like Apport or the
Windows fault handler. The module uses an alternative stack for signal handlers
if the :c:func:`!sigaltstack` function is available. This allows it to dump the
traceback even on a stack overflow.

The fault handler is called on catastrophic cases and therefore can only use
signal-safe functions (e.g. it cannot allocate memory on the heap). Because of
this limitation traceback dumping is minimal compared to normal Python
tracebacks:

* Only ASCII is supported. The ``backslashreplace`` error handler is used on
  encoding.
* Each string is limited to 500 characters.
* Only the filename, the function name and the line number are
  displayed. (no source code)
* It is limited to 100 frames and 100 threads.
* The order is reversed: the most recent call is shown first.

By default, the Python traceback is written to :data:`sys.stderr`. To see
tracebacks, applications must be run in the terminal. A log file can
alternatively be passed to :func:`faulthandler.enable`.

The module is implemented in C, so tracebacks can be dumped on a crash or when
Python is deadlocked.

The :ref:`Python Development Mode <devmode>` calls :func:`faulthandler.enable`
at Python startup.

.. seealso::

   Module :mod:`pdb`
      Interactive source code debugger for Python programs.

   Module :mod:`traceback`
      Standard interface to extract, format and print stack traces of Python programs.

Dumping the traceback
---------------------

.. function:: dump_traceback(file=sys.stderr, all_threads=True)

   Dump the tracebacks of all threads into *file*. If *all_threads* is
   ``False``, dump only the current thread.

   .. seealso:: :func:`traceback.print_tb`, which can be used to print a traceback object.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Added support for passing file descriptor to this function.


Fault handler state
-------------------

.. function:: enable(file=sys.stderr, all_threads=True)

   Enable the fault handler: install handlers for the :const:`~signal.SIGSEGV`,
   :const:`~signal.SIGFPE`, :const:`~signal.SIGABRT`, :const:`~signal.SIGBUS`
   and :const:`~signal.SIGILL`
   signals to dump the Python traceback. If *all_threads* is ``True``,
   produce tracebacks for every running thread. Otherwise, dump only the current
   thread.

   The *file* must be kept open until the fault handler is disabled: see
   :ref:`issue with file descriptors <faulthandler-fd>`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Added support for passing file descriptor to this function.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6
      On Windows, a handler for Windows exception is also installed.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10
      The dump now mentions if a garbage collector collection is running
      if *all_threads* is true.

   .. versionchanged:: next
      Only the current thread is dumped if the :term:`GIL` is disabled to
      prevent the risk of data races.

.. function:: disable()

   Disable the fault handler: uninstall the signal handlers installed by
   :func:`enable`.

.. function:: is_enabled()

   Check if the fault handler is enabled.


Dumping the tracebacks after a timeout
--------------------------------------

.. function:: dump_traceback_later(timeout, repeat=False, file=sys.stderr, exit=False)

   Dump the tracebacks of all threads, after a timeout of *timeout* seconds, or
   every *timeout* seconds if *repeat* is ``True``.  If *exit* is ``True``, call
   :c:func:`!_exit` with status=1 after dumping the tracebacks.  (Note
   :c:func:`!_exit` exits the process immediately, which means it doesn't do any
   cleanup like flushing file buffers.) If the function is called twice, the new
   call replaces previous parameters and resets the timeout. The timer has a
   sub-second resolution.

   The *file* must be kept open until the traceback is dumped or
   :func:`cancel_dump_traceback_later` is called: see :ref:`issue with file
   descriptors <faulthandler-fd>`.

   This function is implemented using a watchdog thread.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Added support for passing file descriptor to this function.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.7
      This function is now always available.

.. function:: cancel_dump_traceback_later()

   Cancel the last call to :func:`dump_traceback_later`.


Dumping the traceback on a user signal
--------------------------------------

.. function:: register(signum, file=sys.stderr, all_threads=True, chain=False)

   Register a user signal: install a handler for the *signum* signal to dump
   the traceback of all threads, or of the current thread if *all_threads* is
   ``False``, into *file*. Call the previous handler if chain is ``True``.

   The *file* must be kept open until the signal is unregistered by
   :func:`unregister`: see :ref:`issue with file descriptors <faulthandler-fd>`.

   Not available on Windows.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Added support for passing file descriptor to this function.

.. function:: unregister(signum)

   Unregister a user signal: uninstall the handler of the *signum* signal
   installed by :func:`register`. Return ``True`` if the signal was registered,
   ``False`` otherwise.

   Not available on Windows.


.. _faulthandler-fd:

Issue with file descriptors
---------------------------

:func:`enable`, :func:`dump_traceback_later` and :func:`register` keep the
file descriptor of their *file* argument. If the file is closed and its file
descriptor is reused by a new file, or if :func:`os.dup2` is used to replace
the file descriptor, the traceback will be written into a different file. Call
these functions again each time that the file is replaced.


Example
-------

Example of a segmentation fault on Linux with and without enabling the fault
handler:

    $ python -q -X faulthandler
    >>> import ctypes
    >>> ctypes.string_at(0)

   :synopsis: The fcntl() and ioctl() system calls.

.. sectionauthor:: Jaap Vermeulen

.. index::
   pair: UNIX; file control
   pair: UNIX; I/O control

----------------

This module performs file and I/O control on file descriptors. It is an
interface to the :c:func:`fcntl` and :c:func:`ioctl` Unix routines.
See the :manpage:`fcntl(2)` and :manpage:`ioctl(2)` Unix manual pages
for full details.

.. availability:: Unix, not WASI.

All functions in this module take a file descriptor *fd* as their first
argument.  This can be an integer file descriptor, such as returned by
``sys.stdin.fileno()``, or an :class:`io.IOBase` object, such as ``sys.stdin``
itself, which provides a :meth:`~io.IOBase.fileno` that returns a genuine file
descriptor.

.. versionchanged:: 3.3
   Operations in this module used to raise an :exc:`IOError` where they now
   raise an :exc:`OSError`.

.. versionchanged:: 3.8
   The :mod:`!fcntl` module now contains ``F_ADD_SEALS``, ``F_GET_SEALS``, and
   ``F_SEAL_*`` constants for sealing of :func:`os.memfd_create` file
   descriptors.

.. versionchanged:: 3.9
   On macOS, the :mod:`!fcntl` module exposes the ``F_GETPATH`` constant,
   which obtains the path of a file from a file descriptor.
   On Linux(>=3.15), the :mod:`!fcntl` module exposes the ``F_OFD_GETLK``,
   ``F_OFD_SETLK`` and ``F_OFD_SETLKW`` constants, which are used when working
   with open file description locks.

.. versionchanged:: 3.10
   On Linux >= 2.6.11, the :mod:`!fcntl` module exposes the ``F_GETPIPE_SZ`` and
   ``F_SETPIPE_SZ`` constants, which allow to check and modify a pipe's size
   respectively.

.. versionchanged:: 3.11
   On FreeBSD, the :mod:`!fcntl` module exposes the ``F_DUP2FD`` and
   ``F_DUP2FD_CLOEXEC`` constants, which allow to duplicate a file descriptor,
   the latter setting ``FD_CLOEXEC`` flag in addition.

.. versionchanged:: 3.12
   On Linux >= 4.5, the :mod:`fcntl` module exposes the ``FICLONE`` and
   ``FICLONERANGE`` constants, which allow to share some data of one file with
   another file by reflinking on some filesystems (e.g., btrfs, OCFS2, and
   XFS). This behavior is commonly referred to as "copy-on-write".

.. versionchanged:: 3.13
   On Linux >= 2.6.32, the :mod:`!fcntl` module exposes the
   ``F_GETOWN_EX``, ``F_SETOWN_EX``, ``F_OWNER_TID``, ``F_OWNER_PID``, ``F_OWNER_PGRP`` constants, which allow to direct I/O availability signals
   to a specific thread, process, or process group.
   On Linux >= 4.13, the :mod:`!fcntl` module exposes the
   ``F_GET_RW_HINT``, ``F_SET_RW_HINT``, ``F_GET_FILE_RW_HINT``,
   ``F_SET_FILE_RW_HINT``, and ``RWH_WRITE_LIFE_*`` constants, which allow
   to inform the kernel about the relative expected lifetime of writes on
   a given inode or via a particular open file description.
   On Linux >= 5.1 and NetBSD, the :mod:`!fcntl` module exposes the
   ``F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE`` constant for use with ``F_ADD_SEALS`` and
   ``F_GET_SEALS`` operations.
   On FreeBSD, the :mod:`!fcntl` module exposes the ``F_READAHEAD``, ``F_ISUNIONSTACK``, and ``F_KINFO`` constants.
   On macOS and FreeBSD, the :mod:`!fcntl` module exposes the ``F_RDAHEAD``
   constant.
   On NetBSD and AIX, the :mod:`!fcntl` module exposes the ``F_CLOSEM``
   constant.
   On NetBSD, the :mod:`!fcntl` module exposes the ``F_MAXFD`` constant.
   On macOS and NetBSD, the :mod:`!fcntl` module exposes the ``F_GETNOSIGPIPE``
   and ``F_SETNOSIGPIPE`` constant.

The module defines the following functions:


.. function:: fcntl(fd, cmd, arg=0)

   Perform the operation *cmd* on file descriptor *fd* (file objects providing
   a :meth:`~io.IOBase.fileno` method are accepted as well).  The values used
   for *cmd* are operating system dependent, and are available as constants
   in the :mod:`fcntl` module, using the same names as used in the relevant C
   header files. The argument *arg* can either be an integer value, or a
   :class:`bytes` object. With an integer value, the return value of this
   function is the integer return value of the C :c:func:`fcntl` call.  When
   the argument is bytes it represents a binary structure, e.g. created by
   :func:`struct.pack`. The binary data is copied to a buffer whose address is
   passed to the C :c:func:`fcntl` call.  The return value after a successful
   call is the contents of the buffer, converted to a :class:`bytes` object.
   The length of the returned object will be the same as the length of the
   *arg* argument. This is limited to 1024 bytes. If the information returned
   in the buffer by the operating system is larger than 1024 bytes, this is
   most likely to result in a segmentation violation or a more subtle data
   corruption.

   If the :c:func:`fcntl` call fails, an :exc:`OSError` is raised.

   .. audit-event:: fcntl.fcntl fd,cmd,arg fcntl.fcntl


.. function:: ioctl(fd, request, arg=0, mutate_flag=True)

   This function is identical to the :func:`~fcntl.fcntl` function, except
   that the argument handling is even more complicated.

   The *request* parameter is limited to values that can fit in 32-bits.
   Additional constants of interest for use as the *request* argument can be
   found in the :mod:`termios` module, under the same names as used in
   the relevant C header files.

   The parameter *arg* can be one of an integer, an object supporting the
   read-only buffer interface (like :class:`bytes`) or an object supporting
   the read-write buffer interface (like :class:`bytearray`).

   In all but the last case, behaviour is as for the :func:`~fcntl.fcntl`
   function.

   If a mutable buffer is passed, then the behaviour is determined by the value of
   the *mutate_flag* parameter.

   If it is false, the buffer's mutability is ignored and behaviour is as for a
   read-only buffer, except that the 1024 byte limit mentioned above is avoided --
   so long as the buffer you pass is at least as long as what the operating system
   wants to put there, things should work.

   If *mutate_flag* is true (the default), then the buffer is (in effect) passed
   to the underlying :func:`ioctl` system call, the latter's return code is
   passed back to the calling Python, and the buffer's new contents reflect the
   action of the :func:`ioctl`.  This is a slight simplification, because if the
   supplied buffer is less than 1024 bytes long it is first copied into a static
   buffer 1024 bytes long which is then passed to :func:`ioctl` and copied back
   into the supplied buffer.

   If the :c:func:`ioctl` call fails, an :exc:`OSError` exception is raised.

   An example::

      >>> import array, fcntl, struct, termios, os
      >>> os.getpgrp()
      13341
      >>> struct.unpack('h', fcntl.ioctl(0, termios.TIOCGPGRP, "  "))[0]
      13341
      >>> buf = array.array('h', [0])
      >>> fcntl.ioctl(0, termios.TIOCGPGRP, buf, 1)
      0
      >>> buf
      array('h', [13341])

   .. audit-event:: fcntl.ioctl fd,request,arg fcntl.ioctl


.. function:: flock(fd, operation)

   Perform the lock operation *operation* on file descriptor *fd* (file objects providing
   a :meth:`~io.IOBase.fileno` method are accepted as well). See the Unix manual
   :manpage:`flock(2)` for details.  (On some systems, this function is emulated
   using :c:func:`fcntl`.)

   If the :c:func:`flock` call fails, an :exc:`OSError` exception is raised.

   .. audit-event:: fcntl.flock fd,operation fcntl.flock


.. function:: lockf(fd, cmd, len=0, start=0, whence=0)

   This is essentially a wrapper around the :func:`~fcntl.fcntl` locking calls.
   *fd* is the file descriptor (file objects providing a :meth:`~io.IOBase.fileno`
   method are accepted as well) of the file to lock or unlock, and *cmd*
   is one of the following values:

   .. data:: LOCK_UN

      Release an existing lock.

   .. data:: LOCK_SH

      Acquire a shared lock.

   .. data:: LOCK_EX

      Acquire an exclusive lock.

   .. data:: LOCK_NB

      Bitwise OR with any of the other three ``LOCK_*`` constants to make
      the request non-blocking.

   If :const:`!LOCK_NB` is used and the lock cannot be acquired, an
   :exc:`OSError` will be raised and the exception will have an *errno*
   attribute set to :const:`~errno.EACCES` or :const:`~errno.EAGAIN` (depending on the
   operating system; for portability, check for both values).  On at least some
   systems, :const:`!LOCK_EX` can only be used if the file descriptor refers to a
   file opened for writing.

   *len* is the number of bytes to lock, *start* is the byte offset at
   which the lock starts, relative to *whence*, and *whence* is as with
   :func:`io.IOBase.seek`, specifically:

   * ``0`` -- relative to the start of the file (:const:`os.SEEK_SET`)
   * ``1`` -- relative to the current buffer position (:const:`os.SEEK_CUR`)
   * ``2`` -- relative to the end of the file (:const:`os.SEEK_END`)

   The default for *start* is 0, which means to start at the beginning of the file.
   The default for *len* is 0 which means to lock to the end of the file.  The
   default for *whence* is also 0.

   .. audit-event:: fcntl.lockf fd,cmd,len,start,whence fcntl.lockf

Examples (all on a SVR4 compliant system)::

   import struct, fcntl, os

   f = open(...)
   rv = fcntl.fcntl(f, fcntl.F_SETFL, os.O_NDELAY)

   lockdata = struct.pack('hhllhh', fcntl.F_WRLCK, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
   rv = fcntl.fcntl(f, fcntl.F_SETLKW, lockdata)

Note that in the first example the return value variable *rv* will hold an
integer value; in the second example it will hold a :class:`bytes` object.  The
structure lay-out for the *lockdata* variable is system dependent --- therefore
using the :func:`flock` call may be better.


.. seealso::

   Module :mod:`os`
      If the locking flags :const:`~os.O_SHLOCK` and :const:`~os.O_EXLOCK` are
      present in the :mod:`os` module (on BSD only), the :func:`os.open`
      function provides an alternative to the :func:`lockf` and :func:`flock`
      functions.

:mod:`!filecmp` --- File and Directory Comparisons
==================================================

.. module:: filecmp
   :synopsis: Compare files efficiently.

.. sectionauthor:: Moshe Zadka <moshez@zadka.site.co.il>

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/filecmp.py`

--------------

The :mod:`filecmp` module defines functions to compare files and directories,
with various optional time/correctness trade-offs. For comparing files,
see also the :mod:`difflib` module.

The :mod:`filecmp` module defines the following functions:


.. function:: cmp(f1, f2, shallow=True)

   Compare the files named *f1* and *f2*, returning ``True`` if they seem equal,
   ``False`` otherwise.

   If *shallow* is true and the :func:`os.stat` signatures (file type, size, and
   modification time) of both files are identical, the files are taken to be
   equal.

   Otherwise, the files are treated as different if their sizes or contents differ.

   Note that no external programs are called from this function, giving it
   portability and efficiency.

   This function uses a cache for past comparisons and the results,
   with cache entries invalidated if the :func:`os.stat` information for the
   file changes.  The entire cache may be cleared using :func:`clear_cache`.


.. function:: cmpfiles(dir1, dir2, common, shallow=True)

   Compare the files in the two directories *dir1* and *dir2* whose names are
   given by *common*.

   Returns three lists of file names: *match*, *mismatch*,
   *errors*.  *match* contains the list of files that match, *mismatch* contains
   the names of those that don't, and *errors* lists the names of files which
   could not be compared.  Files are listed in *errors* if they don't exist in
   one of the directories, the user lacks permission to read them or if the
   comparison could not be done for some other reason.

   The *shallow* parameter has the same meaning and default value as for
   :func:`filecmp.cmp`.

   For example, ``cmpfiles('a', 'b', ['c', 'd/e'])`` will compare ``a/c`` with
   ``b/c`` and ``a/d/e`` with ``b/d/e``.  ``'c'`` and ``'d/e'`` will each be in
   one of the three returned lists.


.. function:: clear_cache()

   Clear the filecmp cache. This may be useful if a file is compared so quickly
   after it is modified that it is within the mtime resolution of
   the underlying filesystem.

   .. versionadded:: 3.4


.. _dircmp-objects:

The :class:`dircmp` class
-------------------------

.. class:: dircmp(a, b, ignore=None, hide=None, *, shallow=True)

   Construct a new directory comparison object, to compare the directories *a*
   and *b*.  *ignore* is a list of names to ignore, and defaults to
   :const:`filecmp.DEFAULT_IGNORES`.  *hide* is a list of names to hide, and
   defaults to ``[os.curdir, os.pardir]``.

   The :class:`dircmp` class compares files by doing *shallow* comparisons
   as described for :func:`filecmp.cmp` by default using the *shallow*
   parameter.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.13

      Added the *shallow* parameter.

   The :class:`dircmp` class provides the following methods:

   .. method:: report()

      Print (to :data:`sys.stdout`) a comparison between *a* and *b*.

   .. method:: report_partial_closure()

      Print a comparison between *a* and *b* and common immediate
      subdirectories.

   .. method:: report_full_closure()

      Print a comparison between *a* and *b* and common subdirectories
      (recursively).

   The :class:`dircmp` class offers a number of interesting attributes that may be
   used to get various bits of information about the directory trees being
   compared.

   Note that via :meth:`~object.__getattr__` hooks, all attributes are computed lazily,
   so there is no speed penalty if only those attributes which are lightweight
   to compute are used.


   .. attribute:: left

      The directory *a*.


   .. attribute:: right

      The directory *b*.


   .. attribute:: left_list

      Files and subdirectories in *a*, filtered by *hide* and *ignore*.


   .. attribute:: right_list

      Files and subdirectories in *b*, filtered by *hide* and *ignore*.


   .. attribute:: common

      Files and subdirectories in both *a* and *b*.


   .. attribute:: left_only

      Files and subdirectories only in *a*.


   .. attribute:: right_only

      Files and subdirectories only in *b*.


   .. attribute:: common_dirs

      Subdirectories in both *a* and *b*.


   .. attribute:: common_files

      Files in both *a* and *b*.


   .. attribute:: common_funny

      Names in both *a* and *b*, such that the type differs between the
      directories, or names for which :func:`os.stat` reports an error.


   .. attribute:: same_files

      Files which are identical in both *a* and *b*, using the class's
      file comparison operator.


   .. attribute:: diff_files

      Files which are in both *a* and *b*, whose contents differ according
      to the class's file comparison operator.


   .. attribute:: funny_files

      Files which are in both *a* and *b*, but could not be compared.


   .. attribute:: subdirs

      A dictionary mapping names in :attr:`common_dirs` to :class:`dircmp`
      instances (or MyDirCmp instances if this instance is of type MyDirCmp, a
      subclass of :class:`dircmp`).

      .. versionchanged:: 3.10
         Previously entries were always :class:`dircmp` instances. Now entries
         are the same type as *self*, if *self* is a subclass of
         :class:`dircmp`.

.. attribute:: DEFAULT_IGNORES

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

   List of directories ignored by :class:`dircmp` by default.


Here is a simplified example of using the ``subdirs`` attribute to search
recursively through two directories to show common different files::

    >>> from filecmp import dircmp
    >>> def print_diff_files(dcmp):
    ...     for name in dcmp.diff_files:
    ...         print("diff_file %s found in %s and %s" % (name, dcmp.left,
    ...               dcmp.right))
    ...     for sub_dcmp in dcmp.subdirs.values():
    ...         print_diff_files(sub_dcmp)
    ...
    >>> dcmp = dircmp('dir1', 'dir2') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> print_diff_files(dcmp) # doctest: +SKIP

:mod:`!fileinput` --- Iterate over lines from multiple input streams
====================================================================

.. module:: fileinput
   :synopsis: Loop over standard input or a list of files.

.. moduleauthor:: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
.. sectionauthor:: Fred L. Drake, Jr. <fdrake@acm.org>

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/fileinput.py`

--------------

This module implements a helper class and functions to quickly write a
loop over standard input or a list of files. If you just want to read or
write one file see :func:`open`.

The typical use is::

   import fileinput
   for line in fileinput.input(encoding="utf-8"):
       process(line)

This iterates over the lines of all files listed in ``sys.argv[1:]``, defaulting
to ``sys.stdin`` if the list is empty.  If a filename is ``'-'``, it is also
replaced by ``sys.stdin`` and the optional arguments *mode* and *openhook*
are ignored.  To specify an alternative list of filenames, pass it as the
first argument to :func:`.input`.  A single file name is also allowed.

All files are opened in text mode by default, but you can override this by
specifying the *mode* parameter in the call to :func:`.input` or
:class:`FileInput`.  If an I/O error occurs during opening or reading a file,
:exc:`OSError` is raised.

.. versionchanged:: 3.3
   :exc:`IOError` used to be raised; it is now an alias of :exc:`OSError`.

If ``sys.stdin`` is used more than once, the second and further use will return
no lines, except perhaps for interactive use, or if it has been explicitly reset
(e.g. using ``sys.stdin.seek(0)``).

Empty files are opened and immediately closed; the only time their presence in
the list of filenames is noticeable at all is when the last file opened is
empty.

Lines are returned with any newlines intact, which means that the last line in
a file may not have one.

You can control how files are opened by providing an opening hook via the
*openhook* parameter to :func:`fileinput.input` or :func:`FileInput`. The
hook must be a function that takes two arguments, *filename* and *mode*, and
returns an accordingly opened file-like object. If *encoding* and/or *errors*
are specified, they will be passed to the hook as additional keyword arguments.
This module provides a :func:`hook_compressed` to support compressed files.

The following function is the primary interface of this module:


.. function:: input(files=None, inplace=False, backup='', *, mode='r', openhook=None, encoding=None, errors=None)

   Create an instance of the :class:`FileInput` class.  The instance will be used
   as global state for the functions of this module, and is also returned to use
   during iteration.  The parameters to this function will be passed along to the
   constructor of the :class:`FileInput` class.

   The :class:`FileInput` instance can be used as a context manager in the
   :keyword:`with` statement.  In this example, *input* is closed after the
   :keyword:`!with` statement is exited, even if an exception occurs::

      with fileinput.input(files=('spam.txt', 'eggs.txt'), encoding="utf-8") as f:
          for line in f:
              process(line)

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2
      Can be used as a context manager.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.8
      The keyword parameters *mode* and *openhook* are now keyword-only.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10
      The keyword-only parameter *encoding* and *errors* are added.


The following functions use the global state created by :func:`fileinput.input`;
if there is no active state, :exc:`RuntimeError` is raised.


.. function:: filename()

   Return the name of the file currently being read.  Before the first line has
   been read, returns ``None``.


.. function:: fileno()

   Return the integer "file descriptor" for the current file. When no file is
   opened (before the first line and between files), returns ``-1``.


.. function:: lineno()

   Return the cumulative line number of the line that has just been read.  Before
   the first line has been read, returns ``0``.  After the last line of the last
   file has been read, returns the line number of that line.


.. function:: filelineno()

   Return the line number in the current file.  Before the first line has been
   read, returns ``0``.  After the last line of the last file has been read,
   returns the line number of that line within the file.


.. function:: isfirstline()

   Return ``True`` if the line just read is the first line of its file, otherwise
   return ``False``.


.. function:: isstdin()

   Return ``True`` if the last line was read from ``sys.stdin``, otherwise return
   ``False``.


.. function:: nextfile()

   Close the current file so that the next iteration will read the first line from
   the next file (if any); lines not read from the file will not count towards the
   cumulative line count.  The filename is not changed until after the first line
   of the next file has been read.  Before the first line has been read, this
   function has no effect; it cannot be used to skip the first file.  After the
   last line of the last file has been read, this function has no effect.


.. function:: close()

   Close the sequence.

The class which implements the sequence behavior provided by the module is
available for subclassing as well:


.. class:: FileInput(files=None, inplace=False, backup='', *, mode='r', openhook=None, encoding=None, errors=None)

   Class :class:`FileInput` is the implementation; its methods :meth:`filename`,
   :meth:`fileno`, :meth:`lineno`, :meth:`filelineno`, :meth:`isfirstline`,
   :meth:`isstdin`, :meth:`nextfile` and :meth:`close` correspond to the
   functions of the same name in the module. In addition it is :term:`iterable`
   and has a :meth:`~io.TextIOBase.readline` method which returns the next
   input line. The sequence must be accessed in strictly sequential order;
   random access and :meth:`~io.TextIOBase.readline` cannot be mixed.

   With *mode* you can specify which file mode will be passed to :func:`open`. It
   must be one of ``'r'`` and ``'rb'``.

   The *openhook*, when given, must be a function that takes two arguments,
   *filename* and *mode*, and returns an accordingly opened file-like object. You
   cannot use *inplace* and *openhook* together.

   You can specify *encoding* and *errors* that is passed to :func:`open` or *openhook*.

   A :class:`FileInput` instance can be used as a context manager in the
   :keyword:`with` statement.  In this example, *input* is closed after the
   :keyword:`!with` statement is exited, even if an exception occurs::

      with FileInput(files=('spam.txt', 'eggs.txt')) as input:
          process(input)

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2
      Can be used as a context manager.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.8
      The keyword parameter *mode* and *openhook* are now keyword-only.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10
      The keyword-only parameter *encoding* and *errors* are added.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      The ``'rU'`` and ``'U'`` modes and the :meth:`!__getitem__` method have
      been removed.


**Optional in-place filtering:** if the keyword argument ``inplace=True`` is
passed to :func:`fileinput.input` or to the :class:`FileInput` constructor, the
file is moved to a backup file and standard output is directed to the input file
(if a file of the same name as the backup file already exists, it will be
replaced silently).  This makes it possible to write a filter that rewrites its
input file in place.  If the *backup* parameter is given (typically as
``backup='.<some extension>'``), it specifies the extension for the backup file,
and the backup file remains around; by default, the extension is ``'.bak'`` and
it is deleted when the output file is closed.  In-place filtering is disabled
when standard input is read.


The two following opening hooks are provided by this module:

.. function:: hook_compressed(filename, mode, *, encoding=None, errors=None)

   Transparently opens files compressed with gzip and bzip2 (recognized by the
   extensions ``'.gz'`` and ``'.bz2'``) using the :mod:`gzip` and :mod:`bz2`
   modules.  If the filename extension is not ``'.gz'`` or ``'.bz2'``, the file is
   opened normally (ie, using :func:`open` without any decompression).

   The *encoding* and *errors* values are passed to :class:`io.TextIOWrapper`
   for compressed files and open for normal files.

   Usage example:  ``fi = fileinput.FileInput(openhook=fileinput.hook_compressed, encoding="utf-8")``

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10
      The keyword-only parameter *encoding* and *errors* are added.


.. function:: hook_encoded(encoding, errors=None)

   Returns a hook which opens each file with :func:`open`, using the given
   *encoding* and *errors* to read the file.

   Usage example: ``fi =
   fileinput.FileInput(openhook=fileinput.hook_encoded("utf-8",
   "surrogateescape"))``

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6
      Added the optional *errors* parameter.

   .. deprecated:: 3.10
      This function is deprecated since :func:`fileinput.input` and :class:`FileInput`
      now have *encoding* and *errors* parameters.

.. index:: single: filenames; wildcard expansion

.. index:: pair: module; re

--------------

This module provides support for Unix shell-style wildcards, which are *not* the
same as regular expressions (which are documented in the :mod:`re` module).  The
special characters used in shell-style wildcards are:

.. index::
   single: * (asterisk); in glob-style wildcards
   single: ? (question mark); in glob-style wildcards
   single: [] (square brackets); in glob-style wildcards
   single: ! (exclamation); in glob-style wildcards
   single: - (minus); in glob-style wildcards

+------------+------------------------------------+
| Pattern    | Meaning                            |
+============+====================================+
| ``*``      | matches everything                 |
+------------+------------------------------------+
| ``?``      | matches any single character       |
+------------+------------------------------------+
| ``[seq]``  | matches any character in *seq*     |
+------------+------------------------------------+
| ``[!seq]`` | matches any character not in *seq* |
+------------+------------------------------------+

For a literal match, wrap the meta-characters in brackets.
For example, ``'[?]'`` matches the character ``'?'``.

.. index:: pair: module; glob

Note that the filename separator (``'/'`` on Unix) is *not* special to this
module.  See module :mod:`glob` for pathname expansion (:mod:`glob` uses
:func:`.filter` to match pathname segments).  Similarly, filenames starting with
a period are not special for this module, and are matched by the ``*`` and ``?``
patterns.

Also note that :func:`functools.lru_cache` with the *maxsize* of 32768 is used to
cache the compiled regex patterns in the following functions: :func:`fnmatch`,
:func:`fnmatchcase`, :func:`.filter`.

.. function:: fnmatch(name, pat)

   Test whether the filename string *name* matches the pattern string *pat*,
   returning ``True`` or ``False``.  Both parameters are case-normalized
   using :func:`os.path.normcase`. :func:`fnmatchcase` can be used to perform a
   case-sensitive comparison, regardless of whether that's standard for the
   operating system.

   This example will print all file names in the current directory with the
   extension ``.txt``::

      import fnmatch
      import os

      for file in os.listdir('.'):
          if fnmatch.fnmatch(file, '*.txt'):
              print(file)


.. function:: fnmatchcase(name, pat)

   Test whether the filename string *name* matches the pattern string *pat*,
   returning ``True`` or ``False``;
   the comparison is case-sensitive and does not apply :func:`os.path.normcase`.


.. function:: filter(names, pat)

   Construct a list from those elements of the :term:`iterable` *names*
   that match pattern *pat*.
   It is the same as ``[n for n in names if fnmatch(n, pat)]``,
   but implemented more efficiently.


.. function:: translate(pat)

   Return the shell-style pattern *pat* converted to a regular expression for
   using with :func:`re.match`.

   Example:

      >>> import fnmatch, re
      >>>
      >>> regex = fnmatch.translate('*.txt')
      >>> regex
      '(?s:.*\\.txt)\\Z'
      >>> reobj = re.compile(regex)
      >>> reobj.match('foobar.txt')
      <re.Match object; span=(0, 10), match='foobar.txt'>

======================================

.. module:: fractions
   :synopsis: Rational numbers.

.. moduleauthor:: Jeffrey Yasskin <jyasskin at gmail.com>
.. sectionauthor:: Jeffrey Yasskin <jyasskin at gmail.com>

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/fractions.py`

--------------

The :mod:`fractions` module provides support for rational number arithmetic.


A Fraction instance can be constructed from a pair of integers, from
another rational number, or from a string.

.. index:: single: as_integer_ratio()

.. class:: Fraction(numerator=0, denominator=1)
           Fraction(number)
           Fraction(string)

   The first version requires that *numerator* and *denominator* are instances
   of :class:`numbers.Rational` and returns a new :class:`Fraction` instance
   with value ``numerator/denominator``. If *denominator* is ``0``, it
   raises a :exc:`ZeroDivisionError`.

   The second version requires that *number* is an instance of
   :class:`numbers.Rational` or has the :meth:`!as_integer_ratio` method
   (this includes :class:`float` and :class:`decimal.Decimal`).
   It returns a :class:`Fraction` instance with exactly the same value.
   Assumed, that the :meth:`!as_integer_ratio` method returns a pair
   of coprime integers and last one is positive.
   Note that due to the
   usual issues with binary point (see :ref:`tut-fp-issues`), the
   argument to ``Fraction(1.1)`` is not exactly equal to 11/10, and so
   ``Fraction(1.1)`` does *not* return ``Fraction(11, 10)`` as one might expect.
   (But see the documentation for the :meth:`limit_denominator` method below.)

   The last version of the constructor expects a string.
   The usual form for this instance is::

      [sign] numerator ['/' denominator]

   where the optional ``sign`` may be either '+' or '-' and
   ``numerator`` and ``denominator`` (if present) are strings of
   decimal digits (underscores may be used to delimit digits as with
   integral literals in code).  In addition, any string that represents a finite
   value and is accepted by the :class:`float` constructor is also
   accepted by the :class:`Fraction` constructor.  In either form the
   input string may also have leading and/or trailing whitespace.
   Here are some examples::

      >>> from fractions import Fraction
      >>> Fraction(16, -10)
      Fraction(-8, 5)
      >>> Fraction(123)
      Fraction(123, 1)
      >>> Fraction()
      Fraction(0, 1)
      >>> Fraction('3/7')
      Fraction(3, 7)

   The :class:`Fraction` class inherits from the abstract base class
   :class:`numbers.Rational`, and implements all of the methods and
   operations from that class.  :class:`Fraction` instances are :term:`hashable`,
   and should be treated as immutable.  In addition,
   :class:`Fraction` has the following properties and methods:

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2
      The :class:`Fraction` constructor now accepts :class:`float` and
      :class:`decimal.Decimal` instances.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.9
      The :func:`math.gcd` function is now used to normalize the *numerator*
      and *denominator*. :func:`math.gcd` always returns an :class:`int` type.
      Previously, the GCD type depended on *numerator* and *denominator*.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      Underscores are now permitted when creating a :class:`Fraction` instance
      from a string, following :PEP:`515` rules.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      :class:`Fraction` implements ``__int__`` now to satisfy
      ``typing.SupportsInt`` instance checks.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.12
      Space is allowed around the slash for string inputs: ``Fraction('2 / 3')``.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.12
      :class:`Fraction` instances now support float-style formatting, with
      presentation types ``"e"``, ``"E"``, ``"f"``, ``"F"``, ``"g"``, ``"G"``
      and ``"%""``.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.13
      Formatting of :class:`Fraction` instances without a presentation type
      now supports fill, alignment, sign handling, minimum width and grouping.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.14
      The :class:`Fraction` constructor now accepts any objects with the
      :meth:`!as_integer_ratio` method.

   .. attribute:: numerator

      Numerator of the Fraction in lowest term.

   .. attribute:: denominator

      Denominator of the Fraction in lowest term.


   .. method:: as_integer_ratio()

      Return a tuple of two integers, whose ratio is equal
      to the original Fraction.  The ratio is in lowest terms
      and has a positive denominator.

      .. versionadded:: 3.8

   .. method:: is_integer()

      Return ``True`` if the Fraction is an integer.

      .. versionadded:: 3.12

   .. classmethod:: from_float(flt)

      Alternative constructor which only accepts instances of
      :class:`float` or :class:`numbers.Integral`. Beware that
      ``Fraction.from_float(0.3)`` is not the same value as ``Fraction(3, 10)``.

      .. note::

         From Python 3.2 onwards, you can also construct a
         :class:`Fraction` instance directly from a :class:`float`.


   .. classmethod:: from_decimal(dec)

      Alternative constructor which only accepts instances of
      :class:`decimal.Decimal` or :class:`numbers.Integral`.

      .. note::

         From Python 3.2 onwards, you can also construct a
         :class:`Fraction` instance directly from a :class:`decimal.Decimal`
         instance.


   .. classmethod:: from_number(number)

      Alternative constructor which only accepts instances of
      :class:`numbers.Integral`, :class:`numbers.Rational`,
      :class:`float` or :class:`decimal.Decimal`, and objects with
      the :meth:`!as_integer_ratio` method, but not strings.

      .. versionadded:: 3.14


   .. method:: limit_denominator(max_denominator=1000000)

      Finds and returns the closest :class:`Fraction` to ``self`` that has
      denominator at most max_denominator.  This method is useful for finding
      rational approximations to a given floating-point number:

         >>> from fractions import Fraction
         >>> Fraction('3.1415926535897932').limit_denominator(1000)
         Fraction(355, 113)

      or for recovering a rational number that's represented as a float:

         >>> from math import pi, cos
         >>> Fraction(cos(pi/3))
         Fraction(4503599627370497, 9007199254740992)
         >>> Fraction(cos(pi/3)).limit_denominator()
         Fraction(1, 2)
         >>> Fraction(1.1).limit_denominator()
         Fraction(11, 10)


   .. method:: __floor__()

      Returns the greatest :class:`int` ``<= self``.  This method can
      also be accessed through the :func:`math.floor` function:

        >>> from math import floor
        >>> floor(Fraction(355, 113))
        3


   .. method:: __ceil__()

      Returns the least :class:`int` ``>= self``.  This method can
      also be accessed through the :func:`math.ceil` function.


   .. method:: __round__()
               __round__(ndigits)

      The first version returns the nearest :class:`int` to ``self``,
      rounding half to even. The second version rounds ``self`` to the
      nearest multiple of ``Fraction(1, 10**ndigits)`` (logically, if
      ``ndigits`` is negative), again rounding half toward even.  This
      method can also be accessed through the :func:`round` function.

   .. method:: __format__(format_spec, /)

      Provides support for formatting of :class:`Fraction` instances via the
      :meth:`str.format` method, the :func:`format` built-in function, or
      :ref:`Formatted string literals <f-strings>`.

      If the ``format_spec`` format specification string does not end with one
      of the presentation types ``'e'``, ``'E'``, ``'f'``, ``'F'``, ``'g'``,
      ``'G'`` or ``'%'`` then formatting follows the general rules for fill,
      alignment, sign handling, minimum width, and grouping as described in the
      :ref:`format specification mini-language <formatspec>`. The "alternate
      form" flag ``'#'`` is supported: if present, it forces the output string
      to always include an explicit denominator, even when the value being
      formatted is an exact integer. The zero-fill flag ``'0'`` is not
      supported.

      If the ``format_spec`` format specification string ends with one of
      the presentation types ``'e'``, ``'E'``, ``'f'``, ``'F'``, ``'g'``,
      ``'G'`` or ``'%'`` then formatting follows the rules outlined for the
      :class:`float` type in the :ref:`formatspec` section.

      Here are some examples::

         >>> from fractions import Fraction
         >>> format(Fraction(103993, 33102), '_')
         '103_993/33_102'
         >>> format(Fraction(1, 7), '.^+10')
         '...+1/7...'
         >>> format(Fraction(3, 1), '')
         '3'
         >>> format(Fraction(3, 1), '#')
         '3/1'
         >>> format(Fraction(1, 7), '.40g')
         '0.1428571428571428571428571428571428571429'
         >>> format(Fraction('1234567.855'), '_.2f')
         '1_234_567.86'
         >>> f"{Fraction(355, 113):*>20.6e}"
         '********3.141593e+00'
         >>> old_price, new_price = 499, 672
         >>> "{:.2%} price increase".format(Fraction(new_price, old_price) - 1)
         '34.67% price increase'

:mod:`!ftplib` --- FTP protocol client
======================================

.. module:: ftplib
   :synopsis: FTP protocol client (requires sockets).

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/ftplib.py`

.. index::
   pair: FTP; protocol
   single: FTP; ftplib (standard module)

--------------

This module defines the class :class:`FTP` and a few related items. The
:class:`FTP` class implements the client side of the FTP protocol.  You can use
this to write Python programs that perform a variety of automated FTP jobs, such
as mirroring other FTP servers.  It is also used by the module
:mod:`urllib.request` to handle URLs that use FTP.  For more information on FTP
(File Transfer Protocol), see internet :rfc:`959`.

The default encoding is UTF-8, following :rfc:`2640`.

.. include:: ../includes/wasm-notavail.rst

Here's a sample session using the :mod:`ftplib` module::

   >>> from ftplib import FTP
   >>> ftp = FTP('ftp.us.debian.org')  # connect to host, default port
   >>> ftp.login()                     # user anonymous, passwd anonymous@
   '230 Login successful.'
   >>> ftp.cwd('debian')               # change into "debian" directory

FTP objects
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Use substitutions for some param docs so we don't need to repeat them
   in multiple places.

.. |param_doc_user| replace::
   The username to log in with (default: ``'anonymous'``).

.. |param_doc_passwd| replace::
   The password to use when logging in.
   If not given, and if *passwd* is the empty string or ``"-"``,
   a password will be automatically generated.

.. Ideally, we'd like to use the :rfc: directive, but Sphinx will not allow it.

.. |param_doc_acct| replace::
   Account information to be used for the ``ACCT`` FTP command.
   Few systems implement this.
   See `RFC-959 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc959.html>`__
   for more details.

.. |param_doc_source_address| replace::
   A 2-tuple ``(host, port)`` for the socket to bind to as its
   source address before connecting.

.. |param_doc_encoding| replace::
   The encoding for directories and filenames (default: ``'utf-8'``).

.. class:: FTP(host='', user='', passwd='', acct='', timeout=None, \
               source_address=None, *, encoding='utf-8')

   Return a new instance of the :class:`FTP` class.

   :param str host:
      The hostname to connect to.
      If given, :code:`connect(host)` is implicitly called by the constructor.

   :param str user:
      |param_doc_user|
      If given, :code:`login(host, passwd, acct)` is implicitly called
      by the constructor.

   :param str passwd:
      |param_doc_passwd|

   :param str acct:
      |param_doc_acct|

   :param timeout:
      A timeout in seconds for blocking operations like :meth:`connect`
      (default: the global default timeout setting).
   :type timeout: float | None

   :param source_address:
      |param_doc_source_address|
   :type source_address: tuple | None

   :param str encoding:
      |param_doc_encoding|

   The :class:`FTP` class supports the :keyword:`with` statement, e.g.:

    >>> from ftplib import FTP
    >>> with FTP("ftp1.at.proftpd.org") as ftp:
    ...     ftp.login()
    ...     ftp.dir()
    ... # doctest: +SKIP
    '230 Anonymous login ok, restrictions apply.'

    dr-xr-xr-x   3 ftp      ftp            18 Jul 10  2008 Fedora
    >>>

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2
      Support for the :keyword:`with` statement was added.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      *source_address* parameter was added.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.9
      If the *timeout* parameter is set to be zero, it will raise a
      :class:`ValueError` to prevent the creation of a non-blocking socket.
      The *encoding* parameter was added, and the default was changed from
      Latin-1 to UTF-8 to follow :rfc:`2640`.

   Several :class:`!FTP` methods are available in two flavors:
   one for handling text files and another for binary files.
   The methods are named for the command which is used followed by
   ``lines`` for the text version or ``binary`` for the binary version.

   :class:`FTP` instances have the following methods:

   .. method:: FTP.set_debuglevel(level)

      Set the instance's debugging level as an :class:`int`.
      This controls the amount of debugging output printed.
      The debug levels are:

      * ``0`` (default): No debug output.
      * ``1``: Produce a moderate amount of debug output,
        generally a single line per request.
      * ``2`` or higher: Produce the maximum amount of debugging output,
        logging each line sent and received on the control connection.

   .. method:: FTP.connect(host='', port=0, timeout=None, source_address=None)

      Connect to the given host and port.
      This function should be called only once for each instance;
      it should not be called if a *host* argument was given
      when the :class:`FTP` instance was created.
      All other :class:`!FTP` methods can only be called
      after a connection has successfully been made.

      :param str host:
         The host to connect to.

      :param int port:
         The TCP port to connect to (default: ``21``,
         as specified by the FTP protocol specification).
         It is rarely needed to specify a different port number.

      :param timeout:
         A timeout in seconds for the connection attempt
         (default: the global default timeout setting).
      :type timeout: float | None

      :param source_address:
         |param_doc_source_address|
      :type source_address: tuple | None

      .. audit-event:: ftplib.connect self,host,port ftplib.FTP.connect

      .. versionchanged:: 3.3
         *source_address* parameter was added.


   .. method:: FTP.getwelcome()

      Return the welcome message sent by the server in reply to the initial
      connection.  (This message sometimes contains disclaimers or help information
      that may be relevant to the user.)


   .. method:: FTP.login(user='anonymous', passwd='', acct='')

      Log on to the connected FTP server.
      This function should be called only once for each instance,
      after a connection has been established;
      it should not be called if the *host* and *user* arguments were given
      when the :class:`FTP` instance was created.
      Most FTP commands are only allowed after the client has logged in.

      :param str user:
         |param_doc_user|

      :param str passwd:
         |param_doc_passwd|

      :param str acct:
         |param_doc_acct|


   .. method:: FTP.abort()

      Abort a file transfer that is in progress.  Using this does not always work, but
      it's worth a try.


   .. method:: FTP.sendcmd(cmd)

      Send a simple command string to the server and return the response string.

      .. audit-event:: ftplib.sendcmd self,cmd ftplib.FTP.sendcmd


   .. method:: FTP.voidcmd(cmd)

      Send a simple command string to the server and handle the response.  Return
      the response string if the response code corresponds to success (codes in
      the range 200--299).  Raise :exc:`error_reply` otherwise.

      .. audit-event:: ftplib.sendcmd self,cmd ftplib.FTP.voidcmd


   .. method:: FTP.retrbinary(cmd, callback, blocksize=8192, rest=None)

      Retrieve a file in binary transfer mode.

      :param str cmd:
        An appropriate ``RETR`` command: :samp:`"RETR {filename}"`.

      :param callback:
         A single parameter callable that is called
         for each block of data received,
         with its single argument being the data as :class:`bytes`.
      :type callback: :term:`callable`

      :param int blocksize:
         The maximum chunk size to read on the low-level
         :class:`~socket.socket` object created to do the actual transfer.
         This also corresponds to the largest size of data
         that will be passed to *callback*.
         Defaults to ``8192``.

      :param int rest:
         A ``REST`` command to be sent to the server.
         See the documentation for the *rest* parameter of the :meth:`transfercmd` method.


   .. method:: FTP.retrlines(cmd, callback=None)

      Retrieve a file or directory listing in the encoding specified by the
      *encoding* parameter at initialization.
      *cmd* should be an appropriate ``RETR`` command (see :meth:`retrbinary`) or
      a command such as ``LIST`` or ``NLST`` (usually just the string ``'LIST'``).
      ``LIST`` retrieves a list of files and information about those files.
      ``NLST`` retrieves a list of file names.
      The *callback* function is called for each line with a string argument
      containing the line with the trailing CRLF stripped.  The default *callback*
      prints the line to :data:`sys.stdout`.


   .. method:: FTP.set_pasv(val)

      Enable "passive" mode if *val* is true, otherwise disable passive mode.
      Passive mode is on by default.


   .. method:: FTP.storbinary(cmd, fp, blocksize=8192, callback=None, rest=None)

      Store a file in binary transfer mode.

      :param str cmd:
        An appropriate ``STOR`` command: :samp:`"STOR {filename}"`.

      :param fp:
         A file object (opened in binary mode) which is read until EOF,
         using its :meth:`~io.RawIOBase.read` method in blocks of size *blocksize*
         to provide the data to be stored.
      :type fp: :term:`file object`

      :param int blocksize:
         The read block size.
         Defaults to ``8192``.

      :param callback:
         A single parameter callable that is called
         for each block of data sent,
         with its single argument being the data as :class:`bytes`.
      :type callback: :term:`callable`

      :param int rest:
         A ``REST`` command to be sent to the server.
         See the documentation for the *rest* parameter of the :meth:`transfercmd` method.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.2
         The *rest* parameter was added.


   .. method:: FTP.storlines(cmd, fp, callback=None)

      Store a file in line mode.  *cmd* should be an appropriate
      ``STOR`` command (see :meth:`storbinary`).  Lines are read until EOF from the
      :term:`file object` *fp* (opened in binary mode) using its :meth:`~io.IOBase.readline`
      method to provide the data to be stored.  *callback* is an optional single
      parameter callable that is called on each line after it is sent.


   .. method:: FTP.transfercmd(cmd, rest=None)

      Initiate a transfer over the data connection.  If the transfer is active, send an
      ``EPRT`` or  ``PORT`` command and the transfer command specified by *cmd*, and
      accept the connection.  If the server is passive, send an ``EPSV`` or ``PASV``
      command, connect to it, and start the transfer command.  Either way, return the
      socket for the connection.

      If optional *rest* is given, a ``REST`` command is sent to the server, passing
      *rest* as an argument.  *rest* is usually a byte offset into the requested file,
      telling the server to restart sending the file's bytes at the requested offset,
      skipping over the initial bytes.  Note however that the :meth:`transfercmd`
      method converts *rest* to a string with the *encoding* parameter specified
      at initialization, but no check is performed on the string's contents.  If the
      server does not recognize the ``REST`` command, an :exc:`error_reply` exception
      will be raised.  If this happens, simply call :meth:`transfercmd` without a
      *rest* argument.


   .. method:: FTP.ntransfercmd(cmd, rest=None)

      Like :meth:`transfercmd`, but returns a tuple of the data connection and the
      expected size of the data.  If the expected size could not be computed, ``None``
      will be returned as the expected size.  *cmd* and *rest* means the same thing as
      in :meth:`transfercmd`.


   .. method:: FTP.mlsd(path="", facts=[])

      List a directory in a standardized format by using ``MLSD`` command
      (:rfc:`3659`).  If *path* is omitted the current directory is assumed.
      *facts* is a list of strings representing the type of information desired
      (e.g. ``["type", "size", "perm"]``).  Return a generator object yielding a
      tuple of two elements for every file found in path.  First element is the
      file name, the second one is a dictionary containing facts about the file
      name.  Content of this dictionary might be limited by the *facts* argument
      but server is not guaranteed to return all requested facts.

      .. versionadded:: 3.3


   .. method:: FTP.nlst(argument[, ...])

      Return a list of file names as returned by the ``NLST`` command.  The
      optional *argument* is a directory to list (default is the current server
      directory).  Multiple arguments can be used to pass non-standard options to
      the ``NLST`` command.

      .. note:: If your server supports the command, :meth:`mlsd` offers a better API.


   .. method:: FTP.dir(argument[, ...])

      Produce a directory listing as returned by the ``LIST`` command, printing it to
      standard output.  The optional *argument* is a directory to list (default is the
      current server directory).  Multiple arguments can be used to pass non-standard
      options to the ``LIST`` command.  If the last argument is a function, it is used
      as a *callback* function as for :meth:`retrlines`; the default prints to
      :data:`sys.stdout`.  This method returns ``None``.

      .. note:: If your server supports the command, :meth:`mlsd` offers a better API.


   .. method:: FTP.rename(fromname, toname)

      Rename file *fromname* on the server to *toname*.


   .. method:: FTP.delete(filename)

      Remove the file named *filename* from the server.  If successful, returns the
      text of the response, otherwise raises :exc:`error_perm` on permission errors or
      :exc:`error_reply` on other errors.


   .. method:: FTP.cwd(pathname)

      Set the current directory on the server.


   .. method:: FTP.mkd(pathname)

      Create a new directory on the server.


   .. method:: FTP.pwd()

      Return the pathname of the current directory on the server.


   .. method:: FTP.rmd(dirname)

      Remove the directory named *dirname* on the server.


   .. method:: FTP.size(filename)

      Request the size of the file named *filename* on the server.  On success, the
      size of the file is returned as an integer, otherwise ``None`` is returned.
      Note that the ``SIZE`` command is not  standardized, but is supported by many
      common server implementations.


   .. method:: FTP.quit()

      Send a ``QUIT`` command to the server and close the connection. This is the
      "polite" way to close a connection, but it may raise an exception if the server
      responds with an error to the ``QUIT`` command.  This implies a call to the
      :meth:`close` method which renders the :class:`FTP` instance useless for
      subsequent calls (see below).


   .. method:: FTP.close()

      Close the connection unilaterally.  This should not be applied to an already
      closed connection such as after a successful call to :meth:`~FTP.quit`.
      After this call the :class:`FTP` instance should not be used any more (after
      a call to :meth:`close` or :meth:`~FTP.quit` you cannot reopen the
      connection by issuing another :meth:`login` method).


FTP_TLS objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: FTP_TLS(host='', user='', passwd='', acct='', *, context=None, \
                   timeout=None, source_address=None, encoding='utf-8')

   An :class:`FTP` subclass which adds TLS support to FTP as described in
   :rfc:`4217`.
   Connect to port 21 implicitly securing the FTP control connection
   before authenticating.

   .. note::
      The user must explicitly secure the data connection
      by calling the :meth:`prot_p` method.

   :param str host:
      The hostname to connect to.
      If given, :code:`connect(host)` is implicitly called by the constructor.

   :param str user:
      |param_doc_user|
      If given, :code:`login(host, passwd, acct)` is implicitly called
      by the constructor.

   :param str passwd:
      |param_doc_passwd|

   :param str acct:
      |param_doc_acct|

   :param context:
      An SSL context object which allows bundling SSL configuration options,
      certificates and private keys into a single, potentially long-lived,
      structure.
      Please read :ref:`ssl-security` for best practices.
   :type context: :class:`ssl.SSLContext`

   :param timeout:
      A timeout in seconds for blocking operations like :meth:`~FTP.connect`
      (default: the global default timeout setting).
   :type timeout: float | None

   :param source_address:
      |param_doc_source_address|
   :type source_address: tuple | None

   :param str encoding:
      |param_doc_encoding|

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      Added the *source_address* parameter.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      The class now supports hostname check with
      :attr:`ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname` and *Server Name Indication* (see
      :const:`ssl.HAS_SNI`).

   .. versionchanged:: 3.9
      If the *timeout* parameter is set to be zero, it will raise a
      :class:`ValueError` to prevent the creation of a non-blocking socket.
      The *encoding* parameter was added, and the default was changed from
      Latin-1 to UTF-8 to follow :rfc:`2640`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.12
      The deprecated *keyfile* and *certfile* parameters have been removed.

   Here's a sample session using the :class:`FTP_TLS` class::

      >>> ftps = FTP_TLS('ftp.pureftpd.org')
      >>> ftps.login()
      '230 Anonymous user logged in'
      >>> ftps.prot_p()
      '200 Data protection level set to "private"'
      >>> ftps.nlst()
      ['6jack', 'OpenBSD', 'antilink', 'blogbench', 'bsdcam', 'clockspeed', 'djbdns-jedi', 'docs', 'eaccelerator-jedi', 'favicon.ico', 'francotone', 'fugu', 'ignore', 'libpuzzle', 'metalog', 'minidentd', 'misc', 'mysql-udf-global-user-variables', 'php-jenkins-hash', 'php-skein-hash', 'php-webdav', 'phpaudit', 'phpbench', 'pincaster', 'ping', 'posto', 'pub', 'public', 'public_keys', 'pure-ftpd', 'qscan', 'qtc', 'sharedance', 'skycache', 'sound', 'tmp', 'ucarp']

   :class:`!FTP_TLS` class inherits from :class:`FTP`,
   defining these additional methods and attributes:

   .. attribute:: FTP_TLS.ssl_version

      The SSL version to use (defaults to :data:`ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23`).

   .. method:: FTP_TLS.auth()

      Set up a secure control connection by using TLS or SSL, depending on what
      is specified in the :attr:`ssl_version` attribute.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.4
         The method now supports hostname check with
         :attr:`ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname` and *Server Name Indication* (see
         :const:`ssl.HAS_SNI`).

   .. method:: FTP_TLS.ccc()

      Revert control channel back to plaintext.  This can be useful to take
      advantage of firewalls that know how to handle NAT with non-secure FTP
      without opening fixed ports.

      .. versionadded:: 3.3

   .. method:: FTP_TLS.prot_p()

      Set up secure data connection.

   .. method:: FTP_TLS.prot_c()

      Set up clear text data connection.


Module variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. exception:: error_reply

   Exception raised when an unexpected reply is received from the server.


.. exception:: error_temp

   Exception raised when an error code signifying a temporary error (response
   codes in the range 400--499) is received.


.. exception:: error_perm

   Exception raised when an error code signifying a permanent error (response
   codes in the range 500--599) is received.


.. exception:: error_proto

   Exception raised when a reply is received from the server that does not fit
   the response specifications of the File Transfer Protocol, i.e. begin with a
   digit in the range 1--5.


.. data:: all_errors

   The set of all exceptions (as a tuple) that methods of :class:`FTP`
   instances may raise as a result of problems with the FTP connection (as
   opposed to programming errors made by the caller).  This set includes the
   four exceptions listed above as well as :exc:`OSError` and :exc:`EOFError`.


.. seealso::

   Module :mod:`netrc`
      Parser for the :file:`.netrc` file format.  The file :file:`.netrc` is
      typically used by FTP clients to load user authentication information
      before prompting the user.

--------------

The :mod:`functools` module is for higher-order functions: functions that act on
or return other functions. In general, any callable object can be treated as a
function for the purposes of this module.

The :mod:`functools` module defines the following functions:

.. decorator:: cache(user_function)

   Simple lightweight unbounded function cache.  Sometimes called
   `"memoize" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization>`_.

   Returns the same as ``lru_cache(maxsize=None)``, creating a thin
   wrapper around a dictionary lookup for the function arguments.  Because it
   never needs to evict old values, this is smaller and faster than
   :func:`lru_cache` with a size limit.

   For example::

        @cache
        def factorial(n):
            return n * factorial(n-1) if n else 1

        >>> factorial(10)      # no previously cached result, makes 11 recursive calls
        3628800
        >>> factorial(5)       # just looks up cached value result
        120
        >>> factorial(12)      # makes two new recursive calls, the other 10 are cached
        479001600

   The cache is threadsafe so that the wrapped function can be used in
   multiple threads.  This means that the underlying data structure will
   remain coherent during concurrent updates.

   It is possible for the wrapped function to be called more than once if
   another thread makes an additional call before the initial call has been
   completed and cached.

   .. versionadded:: 3.9


.. decorator:: cached_property(func)

   Transform a method of a class into a property whose value is computed once
   and then cached as a normal attribute for the life of the instance. Similar
   to :func:`property`, with the addition of caching. Useful for expensive
   computed properties of instances that are otherwise effectively immutable.

   Example::

       class DataSet:

           def __init__(self, sequence_of_numbers):
               self._data = tuple(sequence_of_numbers)

           @cached_property
           def stdev(self):
               return statistics.stdev(self._data)

   The mechanics of :func:`cached_property` are somewhat different from
   :func:`property`.  A regular property blocks attribute writes unless a
   setter is defined. In contrast, a *cached_property* allows writes.

   The *cached_property* decorator only runs on lookups and only when an
   attribute of the same name doesn't exist.  When it does run, the
   *cached_property* writes to the attribute with the same name. Subsequent
   attribute reads and writes take precedence over the *cached_property*
   method and it works like a normal attribute.

   The cached value can be cleared by deleting the attribute.  This
   allows the *cached_property* method to run again.

   The *cached_property* does not prevent a possible race condition in
   multi-threaded usage. The getter function could run more than once on the
   same instance, with the latest run setting the cached value. If the cached
   property is idempotent or otherwise not harmful to run more than once on an
   instance, this is fine. If synchronization is needed, implement the necessary
   locking inside the decorated getter function or around the cached property
   access.

   Note, this decorator interferes with the operation of :pep:`412`
   key-sharing dictionaries.  This means that instance dictionaries
   can take more space than usual.

   Also, this decorator requires that the ``__dict__`` attribute on each instance
   be a mutable mapping. This means it will not work with some types, such as
   metaclasses (since the ``__dict__`` attributes on type instances are
   read-only proxies for the class namespace), and those that specify
   ``__slots__`` without including ``__dict__`` as one of the defined slots
   (as such classes don't provide a ``__dict__`` attribute at all).

   If a mutable mapping is not available or if space-efficient key sharing is
   desired, an effect similar to :func:`cached_property` can also be achieved by
   stacking :func:`property` on top of :func:`lru_cache`. See
   :ref:`faq-cache-method-calls` for more details on how this differs from :func:`cached_property`.

   .. versionadded:: 3.8

   .. versionchanged:: 3.12
      Prior to Python 3.12, ``cached_property`` included an undocumented lock to
      ensure that in multi-threaded usage the getter function was guaranteed to
      run only once per instance. However, the lock was per-property, not
      per-instance, which could result in unacceptably high lock contention. In
      Python 3.12+ this locking is removed.


.. function:: cmp_to_key(func)

   Transform an old-style comparison function to a :term:`key function`.  Used
   with tools that accept key functions (such as :func:`sorted`, :func:`min`,
   :func:`max`, :func:`heapq.nlargest`, :func:`heapq.nsmallest`,
   :func:`itertools.groupby`).  This function is primarily used as a transition
   tool for programs being converted from Python 2 which supported the use of
   comparison functions.

   A comparison function is any callable that accepts two arguments, compares them,
   and returns a negative number for less-than, zero for equality, or a positive
   number for greater-than.  A key function is a callable that accepts one
   argument and returns another value to be used as the sort key.

   Example::

       sorted(iterable, key=cmp_to_key(locale.strcoll))  # locale-aware sort order

   For sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see :ref:`sortinghowto`.

   .. versionadded:: 3.2


.. decorator:: lru_cache(user_function)
               lru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False)

   Decorator to wrap a function with a memoizing callable that saves up to the
   *maxsize* most recent calls.  It can save time when an expensive or I/O bound
   function is periodically called with the same arguments.

   The cache is threadsafe so that the wrapped function can be used in
   multiple threads.  This means that the underlying data structure will
   remain coherent during concurrent updates.

   It is possible for the wrapped function to be called more than once if
   another thread makes an additional call before the initial call has been
   completed and cached.

   Since a dictionary is used to cache results, the positional and keyword
   arguments to the function must be :term:`hashable`.

   Distinct argument patterns may be considered to be distinct calls with
   separate cache entries.  For example, ``f(a=1, b=2)`` and ``f(b=2, a=1)``
   differ in their keyword argument order and may have two separate cache
   entries.

   If *user_function* is specified, it must be a callable. This allows the
   *lru_cache* decorator to be applied directly to a user function, leaving
   the *maxsize* at its default value of 128::

       @lru_cache
       def count_vowels(sentence):
           return sum(sentence.count(vowel) for vowel in 'AEIOUaeiou')

   If *maxsize* is set to ``None``, the LRU feature is disabled and the cache can
   grow without bound.

   If *typed* is set to true, function arguments of different types will be
   cached separately.  If *typed* is false, the implementation will usually
   regard them as equivalent calls and only cache a single result. (Some
   types such as *str* and *int* may be cached separately even when *typed*
   is false.)

   Note, type specificity applies only to the function's immediate arguments
   rather than their contents.  The scalar arguments, ``Decimal(42)`` and
   ``Fraction(42)`` are be treated as distinct calls with distinct results.
   In contrast, the tuple arguments ``('answer', Decimal(42))`` and
   ``('answer', Fraction(42))`` are treated as equivalent.

   The wrapped function is instrumented with a :func:`!cache_parameters`
   function that returns a new :class:`dict` showing the values for *maxsize*
   and *typed*.  This is for information purposes only.  Mutating the values
   has no effect.

   To help measure the effectiveness of the cache and tune the *maxsize*
   parameter, the wrapped function is instrumented with a :func:`cache_info`
   function that returns a :term:`named tuple` showing *hits*, *misses*,
   *maxsize* and *currsize*.

   The decorator also provides a :func:`cache_clear` function for clearing or
   invalidating the cache.

   The original underlying function is accessible through the
   :attr:`__wrapped__` attribute.  This is useful for introspection, for
   bypassing the cache, or for rewrapping the function with a different cache.

   The cache keeps references to the arguments and return values until they age
   out of the cache or until the cache is cleared.

   If a method is cached, the ``self`` instance argument is included in the
   cache.  See :ref:`faq-cache-method-calls`

   An `LRU (least recently used) cache
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_Recently_Used_(LRU)>`_
   works best when the most recent calls are the best predictors of upcoming
   calls (for example, the most popular articles on a news server tend to
   change each day).  The cache's size limit assures that the cache does not
   grow without bound on long-running processes such as web servers.

   In general, the LRU cache should only be used when you want to reuse
   previously computed values.  Accordingly, it doesn't make sense to cache
   functions with side-effects, functions that need to create
   distinct mutable objects on each call (such as generators and async functions),
   or impure functions such as time() or random().

   Example of an LRU cache for static web content::

        @lru_cache(maxsize=32)
        def get_pep(num):
            'Retrieve text of a Python Enhancement Proposal'
            resource = f'https://peps.python.org/pep-{num:04d}'
            try:
                with urllib.request.urlopen(resource) as s:
                    return s.read()
            except urllib.error.HTTPError:
                return 'Not Found'

        >>> for n in 8, 290, 308, 320, 8, 218, 320, 279, 289, 320, 9991:
        ...     pep = get_pep(n)
        ...     print(n, len(pep))

        >>> get_pep.cache_info()
        CacheInfo(hits=3, misses=8, maxsize=32, currsize=8)

   Example of efficiently computing
   `Fibonacci numbers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number>`_
   using a cache to implement a
   `dynamic programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming>`_
   technique::

        @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
        def fib(n):
            if n < 2:
                return n
            return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

        >>> [fib(n) for n in range(16)]
        [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610]

        >>> fib.cache_info()
        CacheInfo(hits=28, misses=16, maxsize=None, currsize=16)

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      Added the *typed* option.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.8
      Added the *user_function* option.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.9
      Added the function :func:`!cache_parameters`

.. decorator:: total_ordering

   Given a class defining one or more rich comparison ordering methods, this
   class decorator supplies the rest.  This simplifies the effort involved
   in specifying all of the possible rich comparison operations:

   The class must define one of :meth:`__lt__`, :meth:`__le__`,
   :meth:`__gt__`, or :meth:`__ge__`.
   In addition, the class should supply an :meth:`__eq__` method.

   For example::

       @total_ordering
       class Student:
           def _is_valid_operand(self, other):
               return (hasattr(other, "lastname") and
                       hasattr(other, "firstname"))
           def __eq__(self, other):
               if not self._is_valid_operand(other):
                   return NotImplemented
               return ((self.lastname.lower(), self.firstname.lower()) ==
                       (other.lastname.lower(), other.firstname.lower()))
           def __lt__(self, other):
               if not self._is_valid_operand(other):
                   return NotImplemented
               return ((self.lastname.lower(), self.firstname.lower()) <
                       (other.lastname.lower(), other.firstname.lower()))

   .. note::

      While this decorator makes it easy to create well behaved totally
      ordered types, it *does* come at the cost of slower execution and
      more complex stack traces for the derived comparison methods. If
      performance benchmarking indicates this is a bottleneck for a given
      application, implementing all six rich comparison methods instead is
      likely to provide an easy speed boost.

   .. note::

      This decorator makes no attempt to override methods that have been
      declared in the class *or its superclasses*. Meaning that if a
      superclass defines a comparison operator, *total_ordering* will not
      implement it again, even if the original method is abstract.

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      Returning ``NotImplemented`` from the underlying comparison function for
      unrecognised types is now supported.

.. data:: Placeholder

   A singleton object used as a sentinel to reserve a place
   for positional arguments when calling :func:`partial`
   and :func:`partialmethod`.

   .. versionadded:: 3.14

.. function:: partial(func, /, *args, **keywords)

   Return a new :ref:`partial object<partial-objects>` which when called
   will behave like *func* called with the positional arguments *args*
   and keyword arguments *keywords*. If more arguments are supplied to the
   call, they are appended to *args*. If additional keyword arguments are
   supplied, they extend and override *keywords*.
   Roughly equivalent to::

      def partial(func, /, *args, **keywords):
          def newfunc(*more_args, **more_keywords):
              return func(*args, *more_args, **(keywords | more_keywords))
          newfunc.func = func
          newfunc.args = args
          newfunc.keywords = keywords
          return newfunc

   The :func:`!partial` function is used for partial function application which "freezes"
   some portion of a function's arguments and/or keywords resulting in a new object
   with a simplified signature.  For example, :func:`partial` can be used to create
   a callable that behaves like the :func:`int` function where the *base* argument
   defaults to ``2``:

   .. doctest::

      >>> basetwo = partial(int, base=2)
      >>> basetwo.__doc__ = 'Convert base 2 string to an int.'
      >>> basetwo('10010')
      18

   If :data:`Placeholder` sentinels are present in *args*, they will be filled first
   when :func:`!partial` is called. This makes it possible to pre-fill any positional
   argument with a call to :func:`!partial`; without :data:`!Placeholder`,
   only the chosen number of leading positional arguments can be pre-filled.

   If any :data:`!Placeholder` sentinels are present, all must be filled at call time:

   .. doctest::

      >>> say_to_world = partial(print, Placeholder, Placeholder, "world!")
      >>> say_to_world('Hello', 'dear')
      Hello dear world!

   Calling ``say_to_world('Hello')`` raises a :exc:`TypeError`, because
   only one positional argument is provided, but there are two placeholders
   that must be filled in.

   If :func:`!partial` is applied to an existing :func:`!partial` object,
   :data:`!Placeholder` sentinels of the input object are filled in with
   new positional arguments.
   A placeholder can be retained by inserting a new
   :data:`!Placeholder` sentinel to the place held by a previous :data:`!Placeholder`:

   .. doctest::

      >>> from functools import partial, Placeholder as _
      >>> remove = partial(str.replace, _, _, '')
      >>> message = 'Hello, dear dear world!'
      >>> remove(message, ' dear')
      'Hello, world!'
      >>> remove_dear = partial(remove, _, ' dear')
      >>> remove_dear(message)
      'Hello, world!'
      >>> remove_first_dear = partial(remove_dear, _, 1)
      >>> remove_first_dear(message)
      'Hello, dear world!'

   :data:`!Placeholder` has no special treatment when used in a keyword
   argument to :func:`!partial`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.14
      Added support for :data:`Placeholder` in positional arguments.

.. class:: partialmethod(func, /, *args, **keywords)

   Return a new :class:`partialmethod` descriptor which behaves
   like :class:`partial` except that it is designed to be used as a method
   definition rather than being directly callable.

   *func* must be a :term:`descriptor` or a callable (objects which are both,
   like normal functions, are handled as descriptors).

   When *func* is a descriptor (such as a normal Python function,
   :func:`classmethod`, :func:`staticmethod`, :func:`abstractmethod` or
   another instance of :class:`partialmethod`), calls to ``__get__`` are
   delegated to the underlying descriptor, and an appropriate
   :ref:`partial object<partial-objects>` returned as the result.

   When *func* is a non-descriptor callable, an appropriate bound method is
   created dynamically. This behaves like a normal Python function when
   used as a method: the *self* argument will be inserted as the first
   positional argument, even before the *args* and *keywords* supplied to
   the :class:`partialmethod` constructor.

   Example::

      >>> class Cell:
      ...     def __init__(self):
      ...         self._alive = False
      ...     @property
      ...     def alive(self):
      ...         return self._alive
      ...     def set_state(self, state):
      ...         self._alive = bool(state)
      ...     set_alive = partialmethod(set_state, True)
      ...     set_dead = partialmethod(set_state, False)
      ...
      >>> c = Cell()
      >>> c.alive
      False
      >>> c.set_alive()
      >>> c.alive
      True

   .. versionadded:: 3.4


.. function:: reduce(function, iterable, /[, initial])

   Apply *function* of two arguments cumulatively to the items of *iterable*, from
   left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value.  For example,
   ``reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`` calculates ``((((1+2)+3)+4)+5)``.
   The left argument, *x*, is the accumulated value and the right argument, *y*, is
   the update value from the *iterable*.  If the optional *initial* is present,
   it is placed before the items of the iterable in the calculation, and serves as
   a default when the iterable is empty.  If *initial* is not given and
   *iterable* contains only one item, the first item is returned.

   Roughly equivalent to::

      initial_missing = object()

      def reduce(function, iterable, /, initial=initial_missing):
          it = iter(iterable)
          if initial is initial_missing:
              value = next(it)
          else:
              value = initial
          for element in it:
              value = function(value, element)
          return value

   See :func:`itertools.accumulate` for an iterator that yields all intermediate
   values.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.14
      *initial* is now supported as a keyword argument.

.. decorator:: singledispatch

   Transform a function into a :term:`single-dispatch <single
   dispatch>` :term:`generic function`.

   To define a generic function, decorate it with the ``@singledispatch``
   decorator. When defining a function using ``@singledispatch``, note that the
   dispatch happens on the type of the first argument::

     >>> from functools import singledispatch
     >>> @singledispatch
     ... def fun(arg, verbose=False):
     ...     if verbose:
     ...         print("Let me just say,", end=" ")
     ...     print(arg)

   To add overloaded implementations to the function, use the :func:`register`
   attribute of the generic function, which can be used as a decorator.  For
   functions annotated with types, the decorator will infer the type of the
   first argument automatically::

     >>> @fun.register
     ... def _(arg: int, verbose=False):
     ...     if verbose:
     ...         print("Strength in numbers, eh?", end=" ")
     ...     print(arg)
     ...
     >>> @fun.register
     ... def _(arg: list, verbose=False):
     ...     if verbose:
     ...         print("Enumerate this:")
     ...     for i, elem in enumerate(arg):
     ...         print(i, elem)

   :data:`types.UnionType` and :data:`typing.Union` can also be used::

    >>> @fun.register
    ... def _(arg: int | float, verbose=False):
    ...     if verbose:
    ...         print("Strength in numbers, eh?", end=" ")
    ...     print(arg)
    ...
    >>> from typing import Union
    >>> @fun.register
    ... def _(arg: Union[list, set], verbose=False):
    ...     if verbose:
    ...         print("Enumerate this:")
    ...     for i, elem in enumerate(arg):
    ...         print(i, elem)
    ...

   For code which doesn't use type annotations, the appropriate type
   argument can be passed explicitly to the decorator itself::

     >>> @fun.register(complex)
     ... def _(arg, verbose=False):
     ...     if verbose:
     ...         print("Better than complicated.", end=" ")
     ...     print(arg.real, arg.imag)
     ...

   For code that dispatches on a collections type (e.g., ``list``), but wants
   to typehint the items of the collection (e.g., ``list[int]``), the
   dispatch type should be passed explicitly to the decorator itself with the
   typehint going into the function definition::

     >>> @fun.register(list)
     ... def _(arg: list[int], verbose=False):
     ...     if verbose:
     ...         print("Enumerate this:")
     ...     for i, elem in enumerate(arg):
     ...         print(i, elem)

   .. note::

      At runtime the function will dispatch on an instance of a list regardless
      of the type contained within the list i.e. ``[1,2,3]`` will be
      dispatched the same as ``["foo", "bar", "baz"]``. The annotation
      provided in this example is for static type checkers only and has no
      runtime impact.

   To enable registering :term:`lambdas<lambda>` and pre-existing functions,
   the :func:`register` attribute can also be used in a functional form::

     >>> def nothing(arg, verbose=False):
     ...     print("Nothing.")
     ...
     >>> fun.register(type(None), nothing)

   The :func:`register` attribute returns the undecorated function. This
   enables decorator stacking, :mod:`pickling<pickle>`, and the creation
   of unit tests for each variant independently::

     >>> @fun.register(float)
     ... @fun.register(Decimal)
     ... def fun_num(arg, verbose=False):
     ...     if verbose:
     ...         print("Half of your number:", end=" ")
     ...     print(arg / 2)
     ...
     >>> fun_num is fun
     False

   When called, the generic function dispatches on the type of the first
   argument::

     >>> fun("Hello, world.")
     Hello, world.
     >>> fun("test.", verbose=True)
     Let me just say, test.
     >>> fun(42, verbose=True)
     Strength in numbers, eh? 42
     >>> fun(['spam', 'spam', 'eggs', 'spam'], verbose=True)
     Enumerate this:
     0 spam
     1 spam
     2 eggs
     3 spam
     >>> fun(None)
     Nothing.
     >>> fun(1.23)
     0.615

   Where there is no registered implementation for a specific type, its
   method resolution order is used to find a more generic implementation.
   The original function decorated with ``@singledispatch`` is registered
   for the base :class:`object` type, which means it is used if no better
   implementation is found.

   If an implementation is registered to an :term:`abstract base class`,
   virtual subclasses of the base class will be dispatched to that
   implementation::

     >>> from collections.abc import Mapping
     >>> @fun.register
     ... def _(arg: Mapping, verbose=False):
     ...     if verbose:
     ...         print("Keys & Values")
     ...     for key, value in arg.items():
     ...         print(key, "=>", value)
     ...
     >>> fun({"a": "b"})
     a => b

   To check which implementation the generic function will choose for
   a given type, use the ``dispatch()`` attribute::

     >>> fun.dispatch(float)
     <function fun_num at 0x1035a2840>
     >>> fun.dispatch(dict)    # note: default implementation
     <function fun at 0x103fe0000>

   To access all registered implementations, use the read-only ``registry``
   attribute::

    >>> fun.registry.keys()
    dict_keys([<class 'NoneType'>, <class 'int'>, <class 'object'>,
              <class 'decimal.Decimal'>, <class 'list'>,
              <class 'float'>])
    >>> fun.registry[float]
    <function fun_num at 0x1035a2840>
    >>> fun.registry[object]
    <function fun at 0x103fe0000>

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

   .. versionchanged:: 3.7
      The :func:`register` attribute now supports using type annotations.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      The :func:`register` attribute now supports :data:`types.UnionType`
      and :data:`typing.Union` as type annotations.


.. class:: singledispatchmethod(func)

   Transform a method into a :term:`single-dispatch <single
   dispatch>` :term:`generic function`.

   To define a generic method, decorate it with the ``@singledispatchmethod``
   decorator. When defining a function using ``@singledispatchmethod``, note
   that the dispatch happens on the type of the first non-*self* or non-*cls*
   argument::

    class Negator:
        @singledispatchmethod
        def neg(self, arg):
            raise NotImplementedError("Cannot negate a")

        @neg.register
        def _(self, arg: int):
            return -arg

        @neg.register
        def _(self, arg: bool):
            return not arg

   ``@singledispatchmethod`` supports nesting with other decorators such as
   :func:`@classmethod<classmethod>`. Note that to allow for
   ``dispatcher.register``, ``singledispatchmethod`` must be the *outer most*
   decorator. Here is the ``Negator`` class with the ``neg`` methods bound to
   the class, rather than an instance of the class::

    class Negator:
        @singledispatchmethod
        @classmethod
        def neg(cls, arg):
            raise NotImplementedError("Cannot negate a")

        @neg.register
        @classmethod
        def _(cls, arg: int):
            return -arg

        @neg.register
        @classmethod
        def _(cls, arg: bool):
            return not arg

   The same pattern can be used for other similar decorators:
   :func:`@staticmethod<staticmethod>`,
   :func:`@abstractmethod<abc.abstractmethod>`, and others.

   .. versionadded:: 3.8


.. function:: update_wrapper(wrapper, wrapped, assigned=WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS, updated=WRAPPER_UPDATES)

   Update a *wrapper* function to look like the *wrapped* function. The optional
   arguments are tuples to specify which attributes of the original function are
   assigned directly to the matching attributes on the wrapper function and which
   attributes of the wrapper function are updated with the corresponding attributes
   from the original function. The default values for these arguments are the
   module level constants ``WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS`` (which assigns to the wrapper
   function's :attr:`~function.__module__`, :attr:`~function.__name__`,
   :attr:`~function.__qualname__`, :attr:`~function.__annotations__`,
   :attr:`~function.__type_params__`, and :attr:`~function.__doc__`, the
   documentation string) and ``WRAPPER_UPDATES`` (which updates the wrapper
   function's :attr:`~function.__dict__`, i.e. the instance dictionary).

   To allow access to the original function for introspection and other purposes
   (e.g. bypassing a caching decorator such as :func:`lru_cache`), this function
   automatically adds a ``__wrapped__`` attribute to the wrapper that refers to
   the function being wrapped.

   The main intended use for this function is in :term:`decorator` functions which
   wrap the decorated function and return the wrapper. If the wrapper function is
   not updated, the metadata of the returned function will reflect the wrapper
   definition rather than the original function definition, which is typically less
   than helpful.

   :func:`update_wrapper` may be used with callables other than functions. Any
   attributes named in *assigned* or *updated* that are missing from the object
   being wrapped are ignored (i.e. this function will not attempt to set them
   on the wrapper function). :exc:`AttributeError` is still raised if the
   wrapper function itself is missing any attributes named in *updated*.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2
      The ``__wrapped__`` attribute is now automatically added.
      The :attr:`~function.__annotations__` attribute is now copied by default.
      Missing attributes no longer trigger an :exc:`AttributeError`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      The ``__wrapped__`` attribute now always refers to the wrapped
      function, even if that function defined a ``__wrapped__`` attribute.
      (see :issue:`17482`)

   .. versionchanged:: 3.12
      The :attr:`~function.__type_params__` attribute is now copied by default.


.. decorator:: wraps(wrapped, assigned=WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS, updated=WRAPPER_UPDATES)

   This is a convenience function for invoking :func:`update_wrapper` as a
   function decorator when defining a wrapper function.  It is equivalent to
   ``partial(update_wrapper, wrapped=wrapped, assigned=assigned, updated=updated)``.
   For example::

      >>> from functools import wraps
      >>> def my_decorator(f):
      ...     @wraps(f)
      ...     def wrapper(*args, **kwds):
      ...         print('Calling decorated function')
      ...         return f(*args, **kwds)
      ...     return wrapper
      ...
      >>> @my_decorator
      ... def example():
      ...     """Docstring"""
      ...     print('Called example function')
      ...
      >>> example()
      Calling decorated function
      Called example function
      >>> example.__name__
      'example'
      >>> example.__doc__
      'Docstring'

   Without the use of this decorator factory, the name of the example function
   would have been ``'wrapper'``, and the docstring of the original :func:`example`
   would have been lost.


.. _partial-objects:

:class:`partial` Objects
------------------------

:class:`partial` objects are callable objects created by :func:`partial`. They
have three read-only attributes:


.. attribute:: partial.func

   A callable object or function.  Calls to the :class:`partial` object will be
   forwarded to :attr:`func` with new arguments and keywords.


.. attribute:: partial.args

   The leftmost positional arguments that will be prepended to the positional
   arguments provided to a :class:`partial` object call.


.. attribute:: partial.keywords

   The keyword arguments that will be supplied when the :class:`partial` object is
   called.

:class:`partial` objects are like :ref:`function objects <user-defined-funcs>` in that they are
callable, weak referenceable, and can have attributes.  There are some important
differences.  For instance, the :attr:`~definition.__name__` and :attr:`~definition.__doc__` attributes
are not created automatically.

:mod:`!gc` --- Garbage Collector interface
==========================================

.. module:: gc
   :synopsis: Interface to the cycle-detecting garbage collector.

.. moduleauthor:: Neil Schemenauer <nas@arctrix.com>
.. sectionauthor:: Neil Schemenauer <nas@arctrix.com>

--------------

This module provides an interface to the optional garbage collector.  It
provides the ability to disable the collector, tune the collection frequency,
and set debugging options.  It also provides access to unreachable objects that
the collector found but cannot free.  Since the collector supplements the
reference counting already used in Python, you can disable the collector if you
are sure your program does not create reference cycles.  Automatic collection
can be disabled by calling ``gc.disable()``.  To debug a leaking program call
``gc.set_debug(gc.DEBUG_LEAK)``. Notice that this includes
``gc.DEBUG_SAVEALL``, causing garbage-collected objects to be saved in
gc.garbage for inspection.

The :mod:`gc` module provides the following functions:


.. function:: enable()

   Enable automatic garbage collection.


.. function:: disable()

   Disable automatic garbage collection.


.. function:: isenabled()

   Return ``True`` if automatic collection is enabled.


.. function:: collect(generation=2)

   Perform a collection.  The optional argument *generation*
   may be an integer specifying which generation to collect (from 0 to 2).  A
   :exc:`ValueError` is raised if the generation number is invalid. The sum of
   collected objects and uncollectable objects is returned.

   Calling ``gc.collect(0)`` will perform a GC collection on the young generation.

   Calling ``gc.collect(1)`` will perform a GC collection on the young generation
   and an increment of the old generation.

   Calling ``gc.collect(2)`` or ``gc.collect()`` performs a full collection

   The free lists maintained for a number of built-in types are cleared
   whenever a full collection or collection of the highest generation (2)
   is run.  Not all items in some free lists may be freed due to the
   particular implementation, in particular :class:`float`.

   The effect of calling ``gc.collect()`` while the interpreter is already
   performing a collection is undefined.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.13
      ``generation=1`` performs an increment of collection.


.. function:: set_debug(flags)

   Set the garbage collection debugging flags. Debugging information will be
   written to ``sys.stderr``.  See below for a list of debugging flags which can be
   combined using bit operations to control debugging.


.. function:: get_debug()

   Return the debugging flags currently set.


.. function:: get_objects(generation=None)


   Returns a list of all objects tracked by the collector, excluding the list
   returned. If *generation* is not ``None``, return only the objects as follows:

   * 0: All objects in the young generation
   * 1: No objects, as there is no generation 1 (as of Python 3.13)
   * 2: All objects in the old generation

   .. versionchanged:: 3.8
      New *generation* parameter.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.13
      Generation 1 is removed

   .. audit-event:: gc.get_objects generation gc.get_objects

.. function:: get_stats()

   Return a list of three per-generation dictionaries containing collection
   statistics since interpreter start.  The number of keys may change
   in the future, but currently each dictionary will contain the following
   items:

   * ``collections`` is the number of times this generation was collected;

   * ``collected`` is the total number of objects collected inside this
     generation;

   * ``uncollectable`` is the total number of objects which were found
     to be uncollectable (and were therefore moved to the :data:`garbage`
     list) inside this generation.

   .. versionadded:: 3.4


.. function:: set_threshold(threshold0, [threshold1, [threshold2]])

   Set the garbage collection thresholds (the collection frequency). Setting
   *threshold0* to zero disables collection.

   The GC classifies objects into two generations depending on whether they have
   survived a collection. New objects are placed in the young generation. If an
   object survives a collection it is moved into the old generation.

   In order to decide when to run, the collector keeps track of the number of object
   allocations and deallocations since the last collection.  When the number of
   allocations minus the number of deallocations exceeds *threshold0*, collection
   starts. For each collection, all the objects in the young generation and some
   fraction of the old generation is collected.

   The fraction of the old generation that is collected is **inversely** proportional
   to *threshold1*. The larger *threshold1* is, the slower objects in the old generation
   are collected.
   For the default value of 10, 1% of the old generation is scanned during each collection.

   *threshold2* is ignored.

   See `Garbage collector design <https://devguide.python.org/garbage_collector>`_ for more information.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.13
      *threshold2* is ignored


.. function:: get_count()

   Return the current collection  counts as a tuple of ``(count0, count1,
   count2)``.


.. function:: get_threshold()

   Return the current collection thresholds as a tuple of ``(threshold0,
   threshold1, threshold2)``.


.. function:: get_referrers(*objs)

   Return the list of objects that directly refer to any of objs. This function
   will only locate those containers which support garbage collection; extension
   types which do refer to other objects but do not support garbage collection will
   not be found.

   Note that objects which have already been dereferenced, but which live in cycles
   and have not yet been collected by the garbage collector can be listed among the
   resulting referrers.  To get only currently live objects, call :func:`collect`
   before calling :func:`get_referrers`.

   .. warning::
      Care must be taken when using objects returned by :func:`get_referrers` because
      some of them could still be under construction and hence in a temporarily
      invalid state. Avoid using :func:`get_referrers` for any purpose other than
      debugging.

   .. audit-event:: gc.get_referrers objs gc.get_referrers


.. function:: get_referents(*objs)

   Return a list of objects directly referred to by any of the arguments. The
   referents returned are those objects visited by the arguments' C-level
   :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_traverse` methods (if any), and may not be all objects actually
   directly reachable.  :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_traverse` methods are supported only by objects
   that support garbage collection, and are only required to visit objects that may
   be involved in a cycle.  So, for example, if an integer is directly reachable
   from an argument, that integer object may or may not appear in the result list.

   .. audit-event:: gc.get_referents objs gc.get_referents

.. function:: is_tracked(obj)

   Returns ``True`` if the object is currently tracked by the garbage collector,
   ``False`` otherwise.  As a general rule, instances of atomic types aren't
   tracked and instances of non-atomic types (containers, user-defined
   objects...) are.  However, some type-specific optimizations can be present
   in order to suppress the garbage collector footprint of simple instances
   (e.g. dicts containing only atomic keys and values)::

      >>> gc.is_tracked(0)
      False
      >>> gc.is_tracked("a")
      False
      >>> gc.is_tracked([])
      True
      >>> gc.is_tracked({})
      False
      >>> gc.is_tracked({"a": 1})
      True

   .. versionadded:: 3.1


.. function:: is_finalized(obj)

   Returns ``True`` if the given object has been finalized by the
   garbage collector, ``False`` otherwise. ::

      >>> x = None
      >>> class Lazarus:
      ...     def __del__(self):
      ...         global x
      ...         x = self
      ...
      >>> lazarus = Lazarus()
      >>> gc.is_finalized(lazarus)
      False
      >>> del lazarus
      >>> gc.is_finalized(x)
      True

   .. versionadded:: 3.9


.. function:: freeze()

   Freeze all the objects tracked by the garbage collector; move them to a
   permanent generation and ignore them in all the future collections.

   If a process will ``fork()`` without ``exec()``, avoiding unnecessary
   copy-on-write in child processes will maximize memory sharing and reduce
   overall memory usage. This requires both avoiding creation of freed "holes"
   in memory pages in the parent process and ensuring that GC collections in
   child processes won't touch the ``gc_refs`` counter of long-lived objects
   originating in the parent process. To accomplish both, call ``gc.disable()``
   early in the parent process, ``gc.freeze()`` right before ``fork()``, and
   ``gc.enable()`` early in child processes.

   .. versionadded:: 3.7


.. function:: unfreeze()

   Unfreeze the objects in the permanent generation, put them back into the
   oldest generation.

   .. versionadded:: 3.7


.. function:: get_freeze_count()

   Return the number of objects in the permanent generation.

   .. versionadded:: 3.7


The following variables are provided for read-only access (you can mutate the
values but should not rebind them):

.. data:: garbage

   A list of objects which the collector found to be unreachable but could
   not be freed (uncollectable objects).  Starting with Python 3.4, this
   list should be empty most of the time, except when using instances of
   C extension types with a non-``NULL`` ``tp_del`` slot.

   If :const:`DEBUG_SAVEALL` is set, then all unreachable objects will be
   added to this list rather than freed.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2
      If this list is non-empty at :term:`interpreter shutdown`, a
      :exc:`ResourceWarning` is emitted, which is silent by default.  If
      :const:`DEBUG_UNCOLLECTABLE` is set, in addition all uncollectable objects
      are printed.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      Following :pep:`442`, objects with a :meth:`~object.__del__` method don't end
      up in :data:`gc.garbage` anymore.

.. data:: callbacks

   A list of callbacks that will be invoked by the garbage collector before and
   after collection.  The callbacks will be called with two arguments,
   *phase* and *info*.

   *phase* can be one of two values:

      "start": The garbage collection is about to start.

      "stop": The garbage collection has finished.

   *info* is a dict providing more information for the callback.  The following
   keys are currently defined:

      "generation": The oldest generation being collected.

      "collected": When *phase* is "stop", the number of objects
      successfully collected.

      "uncollectable": When *phase* is "stop", the number of objects
      that could not be collected and were put in :data:`garbage`.

   Applications can add their own callbacks to this list.  The primary
   use cases are:

      Gathering statistics about garbage collection, such as how often
      various generations are collected, and how long the collection
      takes.

      Allowing applications to identify and clear their own uncollectable
      types when they appear in :data:`garbage`.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3


The following constants are provided for use with :func:`set_debug`:


.. data:: DEBUG_STATS

   Print statistics during collection.  This information can be useful when tuning
   the collection frequency.


.. data:: DEBUG_COLLECTABLE

   Print information on collectable objects found.


.. data:: DEBUG_UNCOLLECTABLE

   Print information of uncollectable objects found (objects which are not
   reachable but cannot be freed by the collector).  These objects will be added
   to the ``garbage`` list.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2
      Also print the contents of the :data:`garbage` list at
      :term:`interpreter shutdown`, if it isn't empty.

.. data:: DEBUG_SAVEALL

   When set, all unreachable objects found will be appended to *garbage* rather
   than being freed.  This can be useful for debugging a leaking program.


.. data:: DEBUG_LEAK

   The debugging flags necessary for the collector to print information about a
   leaking program (equal to ``DEBUG_COLLECTABLE | DEBUG_UNCOLLECTABLE |
   DEBUG_SAVEALL``).

:mod:`!getopt` --- C-style parser for command line options
==========================================================

.. module:: getopt
   :synopsis: Portable parser for command line options; support both short and
              long option names.

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/getopt.py`

.. note::

   This module is considered feature complete. A more declarative and
   extensible alternative to this API is provided in the :mod:`optparse`
   module. Further functional enhancements for command line parameter
   processing are provided either as third party modules on PyPI,
   or else as features in the :mod:`argparse` module.

--------------

This module helps scripts to parse the command line arguments in ``sys.argv``.
It supports the same conventions as the Unix :c:func:`!getopt` function (including
the special meanings of arguments of the form '``-``' and '``--``').  Long
options similar to those supported by GNU software may be used as well via an
optional third argument.

Users who are unfamiliar with the Unix :c:func:`!getopt` function should consider
using the :mod:`argparse` module instead. Users who are familiar with the Unix
:c:func:`!getopt` function, but would like to get equivalent behavior while
writing less code and getting better help and error messages should consider
using the :mod:`optparse` module. See :ref:`choosing-an-argument-parser` for
additional details.

This module provides two functions and an
exception:


.. function:: getopt(args, shortopts, longopts=[])

   Parses command line options and parameter list.  *args* is the argument list to
   be parsed, without the leading reference to the running program. Typically, this
   means ``sys.argv[1:]``. *shortopts* is the string of option letters that the
   script wants to recognize, with options that require an argument followed by a
   colon (``':'``) and options that accept an optional argument followed by
   two colons (``'::'``); i.e., the same format that Unix :c:func:`!getopt` uses.

   .. note::

      Unlike GNU :c:func:`!getopt`, after a non-option argument, all further
      arguments are considered also non-options. This is similar to the way
      non-GNU Unix systems work.

   *longopts*, if specified, must be a list of strings with the names of the
   long options which should be supported.  The leading ``'--'`` characters
   should not be included in the option name.  Long options which require an
   argument should be followed by an equal sign (``'='``).
   Long options which accept an optional argument should be followed by
   an equal sign and question mark (``'=?'``).
   To accept only long options, *shortopts* should be an
   empty string.  Long options on the command line can be recognized so long as
   they provide a prefix of the option name that matches exactly one of the
   accepted options.  For example, if *longopts* is ``['foo', 'frob']``, the
   option ``--fo`` will match as ``--foo``, but ``--f`` will
   not match uniquely, so :exc:`GetoptError` will be raised.

   The return value consists of two elements: the first is a list of ``(option,
   value)`` pairs; the second is the list of program arguments left after the
   option list was stripped (this is a trailing slice of *args*).  Each
   option-and-value pair returned has the option as its first element, prefixed
   with a hyphen for short options (e.g., ``'-x'``) or two hyphens for long
   options (e.g., ``'--long-option'``), and the option argument as its
   second element, or an empty string if the option has no argument.  The
   options occur in the list in the same order in which they were found, thus
   allowing multiple occurrences.  Long and short options may be mixed.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.14
      Optional arguments are supported.


.. function:: gnu_getopt(args, shortopts, longopts=[])

   This function works like :func:`getopt`, except that GNU style scanning mode is
   used by default. This means that option and non-option arguments may be
   intermixed. The :func:`getopt` function stops processing options as soon as a
   non-option argument is encountered.

   If the first character of the option string is ``'+'``, or if the environment
   variable :envvar:`!POSIXLY_CORRECT` is set, then option processing stops as
   soon as a non-option argument is encountered.

   If the first character of the option string is ``'-'``, non-option arguments
   that are followed by options are added to the list of option-and-value pairs
   as a pair that has ``None`` as its first element and the list of non-option
   arguments as its second element.
   The second element of the :func:`!gnu_getopt` result is a list of
   program arguments after the last option.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.14
      Support for returning intermixed options and non-option arguments in order.


.. exception:: GetoptError

   This is raised when an unrecognized option is found in the argument list or when
   an option requiring an argument is given none. The argument to the exception is
   a string indicating the cause of the error.  For long options, an argument given
   to an option which does not require one will also cause this exception to be
   raised.  The attributes :attr:`!msg` and :attr:`!opt` give the error message and
   related option; if there is no specific option to which the exception relates,
   :attr:`!opt` is an empty string.

.. XXX deprecated?
.. exception:: error

   Alias for :exc:`GetoptError`; for backward compatibility.

An example using only Unix style options:

.. doctest::

   >>> import getopt
   >>> args = '-a -b -cfoo -d bar a1 a2'.split()
   >>> args
   ['-a', '-b', '-cfoo', '-d', 'bar', 'a1', 'a2']
   >>> optlist, args = getopt.getopt(args, 'abc:d:')
   >>> optlist
   [('-a', ''), ('-b', ''), ('-c', 'foo'), ('-d', 'bar')]
   >>> args
   ['a1', 'a2']

Using long option names is equally easy:

.. doctest::

   >>> s = '--condition=foo --testing --output-file abc.def -x a1 a2'
   >>> args = s.split()
   >>> args
   ['--condition=foo', '--testing', '--output-file', 'abc.def', '-x', 'a1', 'a2']
   >>> optlist, args = getopt.getopt(args, 'x', [
   ...     'condition=', 'output-file=', 'testing'])
   >>> optlist
   [('--condition', 'foo'), ('--testing', ''), ('--output-file', 'abc.def'), ('-x', '')]
   >>> args
   ['a1', 'a2']

Optional arguments should be specified explicitly:

.. doctest::

   >>> s = '-Con -C --color=off --color a1 a2'
   >>> args = s.split()
   >>> args
   ['-Con', '-C', '--color=off', '--color', 'a1', 'a2']
   >>> optlist, args = getopt.getopt(args, 'C::', ['color=?'])
   >>> optlist
   [('-C', 'on'), ('-C', ''), ('--color', 'off'), ('--color', '')]
   >>> args
   ['a1', 'a2']

The order of options and non-option arguments can be preserved:

.. doctest::

   >>> s = 'a1 -x a2 a3 a4 --long a5 a6'
   >>> args = s.split()
   >>> args
   ['a1', '-x', 'a2', 'a3', 'a4', '--long', 'a5', 'a6']
   >>> optlist, args = getopt.gnu_getopt(args, '-x:', ['long='])
   >>> optlist
   [(None, ['a1']), ('-x', 'a2'), (None, ['a3', 'a4']), ('--long', 'a5')]
   >>> args
   ['a6']

In a script, typical usage is something like this:

.. testcode::

   import getopt, sys

   def main():
       try:
           opts, args = getopt.getopt(sys.argv[1:], "ho:v", ["help", "output="])
       except getopt.GetoptError as err:
           # print help information and exit:
           print(err)  # will print something like "option -a not recognized"
           usage()
           sys.exit(2)
       output = None
       verbose = False
       for o, a in opts:
           if o == "-v":
               verbose = True
           elif o in ("-h", "--help"):
               usage()
               sys.exit()
           elif o in ("-o", "--output"):
               output = a
           else:
               assert False, "unhandled option"
       process(args, output=output, verbose=verbose)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()

Note that an equivalent command line interface could be produced with less code
and more informative help and error messages by using the :mod:`optparse` module:

.. testcode::

   import optparse

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       parser = optparse.OptionParser()
       parser.add_option('-o', '--output')
       parser.add_option('-v', dest='verbose', action='store_true')
       opts, args = parser.parse_args()
       process(args, output=opts.output, verbose=opts.verbose)

A roughly equivalent command line interface for this case can also be
produced by using the :mod:`argparse` module:

.. testcode::

   import argparse

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
       parser.add_argument('-o', '--output')
       parser.add_argument('-v', dest='verbose', action='store_true')
       parser.add_argument('rest', nargs='*')
       args = parser.parse_args()
       process(args.rest, output=args.output, verbose=args.verbose)

See :ref:`choosing-an-argument-parser` for details on how the ``argparse``
version of this code differs in behaviour from the ``optparse`` (and
``getopt``) version.

:mod:`!getpass` --- Portable password input
===========================================

.. module:: getpass
   :synopsis: Portable reading of passwords and retrieval of the userid.

.. moduleauthor:: Piers Lauder <piers@cs.su.oz.au>
.. sectionauthor:: Fred L. Drake, Jr. <fdrake@acm.org>
.. Windows (& Mac?) support by Guido van Rossum.

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/getpass.py`

--------------

.. include:: ../includes/wasm-notavail.rst

The :mod:`getpass` module provides two functions:

.. function:: getpass(prompt='Password: ', stream=None)

   Prompt the user for a password without echoing.  The user is prompted using
   the string *prompt*, which defaults to ``'Password: '``.  On Unix, the
   prompt is written to the file-like object *stream* using the replace error
   handler if needed.  *stream* defaults to the controlling terminal
   (:file:`/dev/tty`) or if that is unavailable to ``sys.stderr`` (this
   argument is ignored on Windows).

   If echo free input is unavailable getpass() falls back to printing
   a warning message to *stream* and reading from ``sys.stdin`` and
   issuing a :exc:`GetPassWarning`.

   .. note::
      If you call getpass from within IDLE, the input may be done in the
      terminal you launched IDLE from rather than the idle window itself.

.. exception:: GetPassWarning

   A :exc:`UserWarning` subclass issued when password input may be echoed.


.. function:: getuser()

   Return the "login name" of the user.

   This function checks the environment variables :envvar:`LOGNAME`,
   :envvar:`USER`, :envvar:`!LNAME` and :envvar:`USERNAME`, in order, and
   returns the value of the first one which is set to a non-empty string.  If
   none are set, the login name from the password database is returned on
   systems which support the :mod:`pwd` module, otherwise, an :exc:`OSError`
   is raised.

   In general, this function should be preferred over :func:`os.getlogin`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.13
      Previously, various exceptions beyond just :exc:`OSError` were raised.

.. module:: gettext
   :synopsis: Multilingual internationalization services.

.. moduleauthor:: Barry A. Warsaw <barry@python.org>
.. sectionauthor:: Barry A. Warsaw <barry@python.org>

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/gettext.py`

--------------

The :mod:`gettext` module provides internationalization (I18N) and localization
(L10N) services for your Python modules and applications. It supports both the
GNU :program:`gettext` message catalog API and a higher level, class-based API that may
be more appropriate for Python files.  The interface described below allows you
to write your module and application messages in one natural language, and
provide a catalog of translated messages for running under different natural
languages.

Some hints on localizing your Python modules and applications are also given.


GNU :program:`gettext` API
--------------------------

The :mod:`gettext` module defines the following API, which is very similar to
the GNU :program:`gettext` API.  If you use this API you will affect the
translation of your entire application globally.  Often this is what you want if
your application is monolingual, with the choice of language dependent on the
locale of your user.  If you are localizing a Python module, or if your
application needs to switch languages on the fly, you probably want to use the
class-based API instead.


.. function:: bindtextdomain(domain, localedir=None)

   Bind the *domain* to the locale directory *localedir*.  More concretely,
   :mod:`gettext` will look for binary :file:`.mo` files for the given domain using
   the path (on Unix): :file:`{localedir}/{language}/LC_MESSAGES/{domain}.mo`, where
   *language* is searched for in the environment variables :envvar:`LANGUAGE`,
   :envvar:`LC_ALL`, :envvar:`LC_MESSAGES`, and :envvar:`LANG` respectively.

   If *localedir* is omitted or ``None``, then the current binding for *domain* is
   returned. [#]_


.. function:: textdomain(domain=None)

   Change or query the current global domain.  If *domain* is ``None``, then the
   current global domain is returned, otherwise the global domain is set to
   *domain*, which is returned.


.. index:: single: _ (underscore); gettext
.. function:: gettext(message)

   Return the localized translation of *message*, based on the current global
   domain, language, and locale directory.  This function is usually aliased as
   :func:`!_` in the local namespace (see examples below).


.. function:: dgettext(domain, message)

   Like :func:`.gettext`, but look the message up in the specified *domain*.


.. function:: ngettext(singular, plural, n)

   Like :func:`.gettext`, but consider plural forms. If a translation is found,
   apply the plural formula to *n*, and return the resulting message (some
   languages have more than two plural forms). If no translation is found, return
   *singular* if *n* is 1; return *plural* otherwise.

   The Plural formula is taken from the catalog header. It is a C or Python
   expression that has a free variable *n*; the expression evaluates to the index
   of the plural in the catalog. See
   `the GNU gettext documentation <https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html>`__
   for the precise syntax to be used in :file:`.po` files and the
   formulas for a variety of languages.


.. function:: dngettext(domain, singular, plural, n)

   Like :func:`ngettext`, but look the message up in the specified *domain*.


.. function:: pgettext(context, message)
.. function:: dpgettext(domain, context, message)
.. function:: npgettext(context, singular, plural, n)
.. function:: dnpgettext(domain, context, singular, plural, n)

   Similar to the corresponding functions without the ``p`` in the prefix (that
   is, :func:`gettext`, :func:`dgettext`, :func:`ngettext`, :func:`dngettext`),
   but the translation is restricted to the given message *context*.

   .. versionadded:: 3.8


Note that GNU :program:`gettext` also defines a :func:`!dcgettext` method, but
this was deemed not useful and so it is currently unimplemented.

Here's an example of typical usage for this API::

   import gettext
   gettext.bindtextdomain('myapplication', '/path/to/my/language/directory')
   gettext.textdomain('myapplication')
   _ = gettext.gettext
   # ...
   print(_('This is a translatable string.'))


Class-based API
---------------

The class-based API of the :mod:`gettext` module gives you more flexibility and
greater convenience than the GNU :program:`gettext` API.  It is the recommended
way of localizing your Python applications and modules.  :mod:`!gettext` defines
a :class:`GNUTranslations` class which implements the parsing of GNU :file:`.mo` format
files, and has methods for returning strings. Instances of this class can also
install themselves in the built-in namespace as the function :func:`!_`.


.. function:: find(domain, localedir=None, languages=None, all=False)

   This function implements the standard :file:`.mo` file search algorithm.  It
   takes a *domain*, identical to what :func:`textdomain` takes.  Optional
   *localedir* is as in :func:`bindtextdomain`. Optional *languages* is a list of
   strings, where each string is a language code.

   If *localedir* is not given, then the default system locale directory is used.
   [#]_  If *languages* is not given, then the following environment variables are
   searched: :envvar:`LANGUAGE`, :envvar:`LC_ALL`, :envvar:`LC_MESSAGES`, and
   :envvar:`LANG`.  The first one returning a non-empty value is used for the
   *languages* variable. The environment variables should contain a colon separated
   list of languages, which will be split on the colon to produce the expected list
   of language code strings.

   :func:`find` then expands and normalizes the languages, and then iterates
   through them, searching for an existing file built of these components:

   :file:`{localedir}/{language}/LC_MESSAGES/{domain}.mo`

   The first such file name that exists is returned by :func:`find`. If no such
   file is found, then ``None`` is returned. If *all* is given, it returns a list
   of all file names, in the order in which they appear in the languages list or
   the environment variables.


.. function:: translation(domain, localedir=None, languages=None, class_=None, fallback=False)

   Return a ``*Translations`` instance based on the *domain*, *localedir*,
   and *languages*, which are first passed to :func:`find` to get a list of the
   associated :file:`.mo` file paths.  Instances with identical :file:`.mo` file
   names are cached.  The actual class instantiated is *class_* if
   provided, otherwise :class:`GNUTranslations`.  The class's constructor must
   take a single :term:`file object` argument.

   If multiple files are found, later files are used as fallbacks for earlier ones.
   To allow setting the fallback, :func:`copy.copy` is used to clone each
   translation object from the cache; the actual instance data is still shared with
   the cache.

   If no :file:`.mo` file is found, this function raises :exc:`OSError` if
   *fallback* is false (which is the default), and returns a
   :class:`NullTranslations` instance if *fallback* is true.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      :exc:`IOError` used to be raised, it is now an alias of :exc:`OSError`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      *codeset* parameter is removed.

.. function:: install(domain, localedir=None, *, names=None)

   This installs the function :func:`!_` in Python's builtins namespace, based on
   *domain* and *localedir* which are passed to the function :func:`translation`.

   For the *names* parameter, please see the description of the translation
   object's :meth:`~NullTranslations.install` method.

   As seen below, you usually mark the strings in your application that are
   candidates for translation, by wrapping them in a call to the :func:`!_`
   function, like this::

      print(_('This string will be translated.'))

   For convenience, you want the :func:`!_` function to be installed in Python's
   builtins namespace, so it is easily accessible in all modules of your
   application.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      *names* is now a keyword-only parameter.

The :class:`NullTranslations` class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Translation classes are what actually implement the translation of original
source file message strings to translated message strings. The base class used
by all translation classes is :class:`NullTranslations`; this provides the basic
interface you can use to write your own specialized translation classes.  Here
are the methods of :class:`!NullTranslations`:


.. class:: NullTranslations(fp=None)

   Takes an optional :term:`file object` *fp*, which is ignored by the base class.
   Initializes "protected" instance variables *_info* and *_charset* which are set
   by derived classes, as well as *_fallback*, which is set through
   :meth:`add_fallback`.  It then calls ``self._parse(fp)`` if *fp* is not
   ``None``.

   .. method:: _parse(fp)

      No-op in the base class, this method takes file object *fp*, and reads
      the data from the file, initializing its message catalog.  If you have an
      unsupported message catalog file format, you should override this method
      to parse your format.


   .. method:: add_fallback(fallback)

      Add *fallback* as the fallback object for the current translation object.
      A translation object should consult the fallback if it cannot provide a
      translation for a given message.


   .. method:: gettext(message)

      If a fallback has been set, forward :meth:`!gettext` to the fallback.
      Otherwise, return *message*.  Overridden in derived classes.


   .. method:: ngettext(singular, plural, n)

      If a fallback has been set, forward :meth:`!ngettext` to the fallback.
      Otherwise, return *singular* if *n* is 1; return *plural* otherwise.
      Overridden in derived classes.


   .. method:: pgettext(context, message)

      If a fallback has been set, forward :meth:`pgettext` to the fallback.
      Otherwise, return the translated message.  Overridden in derived classes.

      .. versionadded:: 3.8


   .. method:: npgettext(context, singular, plural, n)

      If a fallback has been set, forward :meth:`npgettext` to the fallback.
      Otherwise, return the translated message.  Overridden in derived classes.

      .. versionadded:: 3.8


   .. method:: info()

      Return a dictionary containing
      the metadata found in the message catalog file.


   .. method:: charset()

      Return the encoding of the message catalog file.


   .. method:: install(names=None)

      This method installs :meth:`.gettext` into the built-in namespace,
      binding it to ``_``.

      If the *names* parameter is given, it must be a sequence containing the
      names of functions you want to install in the builtins namespace in
      addition to :func:`!_`.  Supported names are ``'gettext'``, ``'ngettext'``,
      ``'pgettext'``, and ``'npgettext'``.

      Note that this is only one way, albeit the most convenient way, to make
      the :func:`!_` function available to your application.  Because it affects
      the entire application globally, and specifically the built-in namespace,
      localized modules should never install :func:`!_`. Instead, they should use
      this code to make :func:`!_` available to their module::

         import gettext
         t = gettext.translation('mymodule', ...)
         _ = t.gettext

      This puts :func:`!_` only in the module's global namespace and so only
      affects calls within this module.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.8
         Added ``'pgettext'`` and ``'npgettext'``.


The :class:`GNUTranslations` class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :mod:`!gettext` module provides one additional class derived from
:class:`NullTranslations`: :class:`GNUTranslations`.  This class overrides
:meth:`!_parse` to enable reading GNU :program:`gettext` format :file:`.mo` files
in both big-endian and little-endian format.

:class:`GNUTranslations` parses optional metadata out of the translation
catalog. It is convention with GNU :program:`gettext` to include metadata as
the translation for the empty string. This metadata is in :rfc:`822`\ -style
``key: value`` pairs, and should contain the ``Project-Id-Version`` key.  If the
key ``Content-Type`` is found, then the ``charset`` property is used to
initialize the "protected" :attr:`!_charset` instance variable, defaulting to
``None`` if not found.  If the charset encoding is specified, then all message
ids and message strings read from the catalog are converted to Unicode using
this encoding, else ASCII is assumed.

Since message ids are read as Unicode strings too, all ``*gettext()`` methods
will assume message ids as Unicode strings, not byte strings.

The entire set of key/value pairs are placed into a dictionary and set as the
"protected" :attr:`!_info` instance variable.

If the :file:`.mo` file's magic number is invalid, the major version number is
unexpected, or if other problems occur while reading the file, instantiating a
:class:`GNUTranslations` class can raise :exc:`OSError`.

.. class:: GNUTranslations

   The following methods are overridden from the base class implementation:

   .. method:: gettext(message)

      Look up the *message* id in the catalog and return the corresponding message
      string, as a Unicode string.  If there is no entry in the catalog for the
      *message* id, and a fallback has been set, the look up is forwarded to the
      fallback's :meth:`~NullTranslations.gettext` method.  Otherwise, the
      *message* id is returned.


   .. method:: ngettext(singular, plural, n)

      Do a plural-forms lookup of a message id.  *singular* is used as the message id
      for purposes of lookup in the catalog, while *n* is used to determine which
      plural form to use.  The returned message string is a Unicode string.

      If the message id is not found in the catalog, and a fallback is specified,
      the request is forwarded to the fallback's :meth:`~NullTranslations.ngettext`
      method.  Otherwise, when *n* is 1 *singular* is returned, and *plural* is
      returned in all other cases.

      Here is an example::

         n = len(os.listdir('.'))
         cat = GNUTranslations(somefile)
         message = cat.ngettext(
             'There is %(num)d file in this directory',
             'There are %(num)d files in this directory',
             n) % {'num': n}


   .. method:: pgettext(context, message)

      Look up the *context* and *message* id in the catalog and return the
      corresponding message string, as a Unicode string.  If there is no
      entry in the catalog for the *message* id and *context*, and a fallback
      has been set, the look up is forwarded to the fallback's
      :meth:`pgettext` method.  Otherwise, the *message* id is returned.

      .. versionadded:: 3.8


   .. method:: npgettext(context, singular, plural, n)

      Do a plural-forms lookup of a message id.  *singular* is used as the
      message id for purposes of lookup in the catalog, while *n* is used to
      determine which plural form to use.

      If the message id for *context* is not found in the catalog, and a
      fallback is specified, the request is forwarded to the fallback's
      :meth:`npgettext` method.  Otherwise, when *n* is 1 *singular* is
      returned, and *plural* is returned in all other cases.

      .. versionadded:: 3.8


Solaris message catalog support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Solaris operating system defines its own binary :file:`.mo` file format, but
since no documentation can be found on this format, it is not supported at this
time.


The Catalog constructor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: single: GNOME

GNOME uses a version of the :mod:`gettext` module by James Henstridge, but this
version has a slightly different API.  Its documented usage was::

   import gettext
   cat = gettext.Catalog(domain, localedir)
   _ = cat.gettext
   print(_('hello world'))

For compatibility with this older module, the function :func:`!Catalog` is an
alias for the :func:`translation` function described above.

One difference between this module and Henstridge's: his catalog objects
supported access through a mapping API, but this appears to be unused and so is
not currently supported.

.. _i18n-howto:

Internationalizing your programs and modules
--------------------------------------------

Internationalization (I18N) refers to the operation by which a program is made
aware of multiple languages.  Localization (L10N) refers to the adaptation of
your program, once internationalized, to the local language and cultural habits.
In order to provide multilingual messages for your Python programs, you need to
take the following steps:

#. prepare your program or module by specially marking translatable strings

#. run a suite of tools over your marked files to generate raw messages catalogs

#. create language-specific translations of the message catalogs

#. use the :mod:`gettext` module so that message strings are properly translated

In order to prepare your code for I18N, you need to look at all the strings in
your files.  Any string that needs to be translated should be marked by wrapping
it in ``_('...')`` --- that is, a call to the function :func:`_ <gettext>`.  For example::

   filename = 'mylog.txt'
   message = _('writing a log message')
   with open(filename, 'w') as fp:
       fp.write(message)

In this example, the string ``'writing a log message'`` is marked as a candidate
for translation, while the strings ``'mylog.txt'`` and ``'w'`` are not.

There are a few tools to extract the strings meant for translation.
The original GNU :program:`gettext` only supported C or C++ source
code but its extended version :program:`xgettext` scans code written
in a number of languages, including Python, to find strings marked as
translatable.  `Babel <https://babel.pocoo.org/>`__ is a Python
internationalization library that includes a :file:`pybabel` script to
extract and compile message catalogs.  François Pinard's program
called :program:`xpot` does a similar job and is available as part of
his `po-utils package <https://github.com/pinard/po-utils>`__.

(Python also includes pure-Python versions of these programs, called
:program:`pygettext.py` and :program:`msgfmt.py`; some Python distributions
will install them for you.  :program:`pygettext.py` is similar to
:program:`xgettext`, but only understands Python source code and
cannot handle other programming languages such as C or C++.
:program:`pygettext.py` supports a command-line interface similar to
:program:`xgettext`; for details on its use, run ``pygettext.py
--help``.  :program:`msgfmt.py` is binary compatible with GNU
:program:`msgfmt`.  With these two programs, you may not need the GNU
:program:`gettext` package to internationalize your Python
applications.)

:program:`xgettext`, :program:`pygettext`, and similar tools generate
:file:`.po` files that are message catalogs.  They are structured
human-readable files that contain every marked string in the source
code, along with a placeholder for the translated versions of these
strings.

Copies of these :file:`.po` files are then handed over to the
individual human translators who write translations for every
supported natural language.  They send back the completed
language-specific versions as a :file:`<language-name>.po` file that's
compiled into a machine-readable :file:`.mo` binary catalog file using
the :program:`msgfmt` program.  The :file:`.mo` files are used by the
:mod:`gettext` module for the actual translation processing at
run-time.

How you use the :mod:`gettext` module in your code depends on whether you are
internationalizing a single module or your entire application. The next two
sections will discuss each case.


Localizing your module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are localizing your module, you must take care not to make global
changes, e.g. to the built-in namespace. You should not use the GNU :program:`gettext`
API but instead the class-based API.

Let's say your module is called "spam" and the module's various natural language
translation :file:`.mo` files reside in :file:`/usr/share/locale` in GNU
:program:`gettext` format.  Here's what you would put at the top of your
module::

   import gettext
   t = gettext.translation('spam', '/usr/share/locale')
   _ = t.gettext


Localizing your application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are localizing your application, you can install the :func:`!_` function
globally into the built-in namespace, usually in the main driver file of your
application.  This will let all your application-specific files just use
``_('...')`` without having to explicitly install it in each file.

In the simple case then, you need only add the following bit of code to the main
driver file of your application::

   import gettext
   gettext.install('myapplication')

If you need to set the locale directory, you can pass it into the
:func:`install` function::

   import gettext
   gettext.install('myapplication', '/usr/share/locale')


Changing languages on the fly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your program needs to support many languages at the same time, you may want
to create multiple translation instances and then switch between them
explicitly, like so::

   import gettext

   lang1 = gettext.translation('myapplication', languages=['en'])
   lang2 = gettext.translation('myapplication', languages=['fr'])
   lang3 = gettext.translation('myapplication', languages=['de'])

   # start by using language1
   lang1.install()

   # ... time goes by, user selects language 2
   lang2.install()

   # ... more time goes by, user selects language 3
   lang3.install()


Deferred translations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In most coding situations, strings are translated where they are coded.
Occasionally however, you need to mark strings for translation, but defer actual
translation until later.  A classic example is::

   animals = ['mollusk',
              'albatross',
              'rat',
              'penguin',
              'python', ]
   # ...
   for a in animals:
       print(a)

Here, you want to mark the strings in the ``animals`` list as being
translatable, but you don't actually want to translate them until they are
printed.

Here is one way you can handle this situation::

   def _(message): return message

   animals = [_('mollusk'),
              _('albatross'),
              _('rat'),
              _('penguin'),
              _('python'), ]

   del _

   # ...
   for a in animals:
       print(_(a))

This works because the dummy definition of :func:`!_` simply returns the string
unchanged.  And this dummy definition will temporarily override any definition
of :func:`!_` in the built-in namespace (until the :keyword:`del` command). Take
care, though if you have a previous definition of :func:`!_` in the local
namespace.

Note that the second use of :func:`!_` will not identify "a" as being
translatable to the :program:`gettext` program, because the parameter
is not a string literal.

Another way to handle this is with the following example::

   def N_(message): return message

   animals = [N_('mollusk'),
              N_('albatross'),
              N_('rat'),
              N_('penguin'),
              N_('python'), ]

   # ...
   for a in animals:
       print(_(a))

In this case, you are marking translatable strings with the function
:func:`!N_`, which won't conflict with any definition of :func:`!_`.
However, you will need to teach your message extraction program to
look for translatable strings marked with :func:`!N_`. :program:`xgettext`,
:program:`pygettext`, ``pybabel extract``, and :program:`xpot` all
support this through the use of the :option:`!-k` command-line switch.
The choice of :func:`!N_` here is totally arbitrary; it could have just
as easily been :func:`!MarkThisStringForTranslation`.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] The default locale directory is system dependent; for example, on Red Hat Linux
   it is :file:`/usr/share/locale`, but on Solaris it is :file:`/usr/lib/locale`.
   The :mod:`!gettext` module does not try to support these system dependent
   defaults; instead its default is :file:`{sys.base_prefix}/share/locale` (see
   :data:`sys.base_prefix`). For this reason, it is always best to call
   :func:`bindtextdomain` with an explicit absolute path at the start of your
   application.

:mod:`!glob` --- Unix style pathname pattern expansion
======================================================

.. module:: glob
   :synopsis: Unix shell style pathname pattern expansion.

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/glob.py`

.. index:: single: filenames; pathname expansion

--------------

.. index::
   single: * (asterisk); in glob-style wildcards
   single: ? (question mark); in glob-style wildcards
   single: [] (square brackets); in glob-style wildcards
   single: ! (exclamation); in glob-style wildcards
   single: - (minus); in glob-style wildcards
   single: . (dot); in glob-style wildcards

The :mod:`glob` module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern
according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned in
arbitrary order.  No tilde expansion is done, but ``*``, ``?``, and character
ranges expressed with ``[]`` will be correctly matched.  This is done by using
the :func:`os.scandir` and :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` functions in concert, and
not by actually invoking a subshell.

Note that files beginning with a dot (``.``) can only be matched by
patterns that also start with a dot,
unlike :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` or :func:`pathlib.Path.glob`.
(For tilde and shell variable expansion, use :func:`os.path.expanduser` and
:func:`os.path.expandvars`.)

For a literal match, wrap the meta-characters in brackets.
For example, ``'[?]'`` matches the character ``'?'``.

The :mod:`glob` module defines the following functions:


.. function:: glob(pathname, *, root_dir=None, dir_fd=None, recursive=False, \
                   include_hidden=False)

   Return a possibly empty list of path names that match *pathname*, which must be
   a string containing a path specification. *pathname* can be either absolute
   (like :file:`/usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile`) or relative (like
   :file:`../../Tools/\*/\*.gif`), and can contain shell-style wildcards. Broken
   symlinks are included in the results (as in the shell). Whether or not the
   results are sorted depends on the file system.  If a file that satisfies
   conditions is removed or added during the call of this function, whether
   a path name for that file will be included is unspecified.

   If *root_dir* is not ``None``, it should be a :term:`path-like object`
   specifying the root directory for searching.  It has the same effect on
   :func:`glob` as changing the current directory before calling it.  If
   *pathname* is relative, the result will contain paths relative to
   *root_dir*.

   This function can support :ref:`paths relative to directory descriptors
   <dir_fd>` with the *dir_fd* parameter.

   .. index::
      single: **; in glob-style wildcards

   If *recursive* is true, the pattern "``**``" will match any files and zero or
   more directories, subdirectories and symbolic links to directories. If the
   pattern is followed by an :data:`os.sep` or :data:`os.altsep` then files will not
   match.

   If *include_hidden* is true, "``**``" pattern will match hidden directories.

   .. audit-event:: glob.glob pathname,recursive glob.glob
   .. audit-event:: glob.glob/2 pathname,recursive,root_dir,dir_fd glob.glob

   .. note::
      Using the "``**``" pattern in large directory trees may consume
      an inordinate amount of time.

   .. note::
      This function may return duplicate path names if *pathname*
      contains multiple "``**``" patterns and *recursive* is true.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Support for recursive globs using "``**``".

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10
      Added the *root_dir* and *dir_fd* parameters.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      Added the *include_hidden* parameter.


.. function:: iglob(pathname, *, root_dir=None, dir_fd=None, recursive=False, \
                    include_hidden=False)

   Return an :term:`iterator` which yields the same values as :func:`glob`
   without actually storing them all simultaneously.

   .. audit-event:: glob.glob pathname,recursive glob.iglob
   .. audit-event:: glob.glob/2 pathname,recursive,root_dir,dir_fd glob.iglob

   .. note::
      This function may return duplicate path names if *pathname*
      contains multiple "``**``" patterns and *recursive* is true.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Support for recursive globs using "``**``".

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10
      Added the *root_dir* and *dir_fd* parameters.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      Added the *include_hidden* parameter.


.. function:: escape(pathname)

   Escape all special characters (``'?'``, ``'*'`` and ``'['``).
   This is useful if you want to match an arbitrary literal string that may
   have special characters in it.  Special characters in drive/UNC
   sharepoints are not escaped, e.g. on Windows
   ``escape('//?/c:/Quo vadis?.txt')`` returns ``'//?/c:/Quo vadis[?].txt'``.

   .. versionadded:: 3.4


.. function:: translate(pathname, *, recursive=False, include_hidden=False, seps=None)

   Convert the given path specification to a regular expression for use with
   :func:`re.match`. The path specification can contain shell-style wildcards.

   For example:

      >>> import glob, re
      >>>
      >>> regex = glob.translate('**/*.txt', recursive=True, include_hidden=True)
      >>> regex
      '(?s:(?:.+/)?[^/]*\\.txt)\\Z'
      >>> reobj = re.compile(regex)
      >>> reobj.match('foo/bar/baz.txt')
      <re.Match object; span=(0, 15), match='foo/bar/baz.txt'>

   Path separators and segments are meaningful to this function, unlike
   :func:`fnmatch.translate`. By default wildcards do not match path
   separators, and ``*`` pattern segments match precisely one path segment.

   If *recursive* is true, the pattern segment "``**``" will match any number
   of path segments.

   If *include_hidden* is true, wildcards can match path segments that start
   with a dot (``.``).

   A sequence of path separators may be supplied to the *seps* argument. If
   not given, :data:`os.sep` and :data:`~os.altsep` (if available) are used.

   .. seealso::

     :meth:`pathlib.PurePath.full_match` and :meth:`pathlib.Path.glob`
     methods, which call this function to implement pattern matching and
     globbing.

   .. versionadded:: 3.13


Examples
--------

Consider a directory containing the following files:
:file:`1.gif`, :file:`2.txt`, :file:`card.gif` and a subdirectory :file:`sub`
which contains only the file :file:`3.txt`.  :func:`glob` will produce
the following results.  Notice how any leading components of the path are
preserved. ::

   >>> import glob
   >>> glob.glob('./[0-9].*')
   ['./1.gif', './2.txt']
   >>> glob.glob('*.gif')
   ['1.gif', 'card.gif']
   >>> glob.glob('?.gif')
   ['1.gif']
   >>> glob.glob('**/*.txt', recursive=True)
   ['2.txt', 'sub/3.txt']
   >>> glob.glob('./**/', recursive=True)
   ['./', './sub/']

If the directory contains files starting with ``.`` they won't be matched by
default. For example, consider a directory containing :file:`card.gif` and
:file:`.card.gif`::

   >>> import glob
   >>> glob.glob('*.gif')
   ['card.gif']
   >>> glob.glob('.c*')
   ['.card.gif']

:mod:`!graphlib` --- Functionality to operate with graph-like structures
========================================================================

.. module:: graphlib
   :synopsis: Functionality to operate with graph-like structures


**Source code:** :source:`Lib/graphlib.py`

.. testsetup:: default

   import graphlib
   from graphlib import *

--------------


.. class:: TopologicalSorter(graph=None)

   Provides functionality to topologically sort a graph of :term:`hashable` nodes.

   A topological order is a linear ordering of the vertices in a graph such that
   for every directed edge u -> v from vertex u to vertex v, vertex u comes
   before vertex v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may
   represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that
   one task must be performed before another; in this example, a topological
   ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. A complete topological
   ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that
   is, if it is a directed acyclic graph.

   If the optional *graph* argument is provided it must be a dictionary
   representing a directed acyclic graph where the keys are nodes and the values
   are iterables of all predecessors of that node in the graph (the nodes that
   have edges that point to the value in the key). Additional nodes can be added
   to the graph using the :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.add` method.

   In the general case, the steps required to perform the sorting of a given
   graph are as follows:

   * Create an instance of the :class:`TopologicalSorter` with an optional
     initial graph.
   * Add additional nodes to the graph.
   * Call :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare` on the graph.
   * While :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.is_active` is ``True``, iterate over
     the nodes returned by :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.get_ready` and
     process them. Call :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.done` on each node as it
     finishes processing.

   In case just an immediate sorting of the nodes in the graph is required and
   no parallelism is involved, the convenience method
   :meth:`TopologicalSorter.static_order` can be used directly:

   .. doctest::

       >>> graph = {"D": {"B", "C"}, "C": {"A"}, "B": {"A"}}
       >>> ts = TopologicalSorter(graph)
       >>> tuple(ts.static_order())
       ('A', 'C', 'B', 'D')

   The class is designed to easily support parallel processing of the nodes as
   they become ready. For instance::

       topological_sorter = TopologicalSorter()

       # Add nodes to 'topological_sorter'...

       topological_sorter.prepare()
       while topological_sorter.is_active():
           for node in topological_sorter.get_ready():
               # Worker threads or processes take nodes to work on off the
               # 'task_queue' queue.
               task_queue.put(node)

           # When the work for a node is done, workers put the node in
           # 'finalized_tasks_queue' so we can get more nodes to work on.
           # The definition of 'is_active()' guarantees that, at this point, at
           # least one node has been placed on 'task_queue' that hasn't yet
           # been passed to 'done()', so this blocking 'get()' must (eventually)
           # succeed.  After calling 'done()', we loop back to call 'get_ready()'
           # again, so put newly freed nodes on 'task_queue' as soon as
           # logically possible.
           node = finalized_tasks_queue.get()
           topological_sorter.done(node)

   .. method:: add(node, *predecessors)

      Add a new node and its predecessors to the graph. Both the *node* and all
      elements in *predecessors* must be :term:`hashable`.

      If called multiple times with the same node argument, the set of
      dependencies will be the union of all dependencies passed in.

      It is possible to add a node with no dependencies (*predecessors* is not
      provided) or to provide a dependency twice. If a node that has not been
      provided before is included among *predecessors* it will be automatically
      added to the graph with no predecessors of its own.

      Raises :exc:`ValueError` if called after :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare`.

   .. method:: prepare()

      Mark the graph as finished and check for cycles in the graph. If any cycle
      is detected, :exc:`CycleError` will be raised, but
      :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.get_ready` can still be used to obtain as many
      nodes as possible until cycles block more progress. After a call to this
      function, the graph cannot be modified, and therefore no more nodes can be
      added using :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.add`.

   .. method:: is_active()

      Returns ``True`` if more progress can be made and ``False`` otherwise.
      Progress can be made if cycles do not block the resolution and either
      there are still nodes ready that haven't yet been returned by
      :meth:`TopologicalSorter.get_ready` or the number of nodes marked
      :meth:`TopologicalSorter.done` is less than the number that have been
      returned by :meth:`TopologicalSorter.get_ready`.

      The :meth:`~object.__bool__` method of this class defers to
      this function, so instead of::

          if ts.is_active():
              ...

      it is possible to simply do::

          if ts:
              ...

      Raises :exc:`ValueError` if called without calling
      :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare` previously.

   .. method:: done(*nodes)

      Marks a set of nodes returned by :meth:`TopologicalSorter.get_ready` as
      processed, unblocking any successor of each node in *nodes* for being
      returned in the future by a call to :meth:`TopologicalSorter.get_ready`.

      Raises :exc:`ValueError` if any node in *nodes* has already been marked as
      processed by a previous call to this method or if a node was not added to
      the graph by using :meth:`TopologicalSorter.add`, if called without
      calling :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare` or if node has not yet been
      returned by :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.get_ready`.

   .. method:: get_ready()

      Returns a ``tuple`` with all the nodes that are ready. Initially it
      returns all nodes with no predecessors, and once those are marked as
      processed by calling :meth:`TopologicalSorter.done`, further calls will
      return all new nodes that have all their predecessors already processed.
      Once no more progress can be made, empty tuples are returned.

      Raises :exc:`ValueError` if called without calling
      :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare` previously.

   .. method:: static_order()

      Returns an iterator object which will iterate over nodes in a topological
      order. When using this method, :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare` and
      :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.done` should not be called. This method is
      equivalent to::

          def static_order(self):
              self.prepare()
              while self.is_active():
                  node_group = self.get_ready()
                  yield from node_group
                  self.done(*node_group)

      The particular order that is returned may depend on the specific order in
      which the items were inserted in the graph. For example:

      .. doctest::

          >>> ts = TopologicalSorter()
          >>> ts.add(3, 2, 1)
          >>> ts.add(1, 0)
          >>> print([*ts.static_order()])
          [2, 0, 1, 3]

          >>> ts2 = TopologicalSorter()
          >>> ts2.add(1, 0)
          >>> ts2.add(3, 2, 1)
          >>> print([*ts2.static_order()])
          [0, 2, 1, 3]

      This is due to the fact that "0" and "2" are in the same level in the
      graph (they would have been returned in the same call to
      :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.get_ready`) and the order between them is
      determined by the order of insertion.


      If any cycle is detected, :exc:`CycleError` will be raised.

   .. versionadded:: 3.9


Exceptions
----------
The :mod:`graphlib` module defines the following exception classes:

.. exception:: CycleError

   Subclass of :exc:`ValueError` raised by :meth:`TopologicalSorter.prepare` if cycles exist
   in the working graph. If multiple cycles exist, only one undefined choice among them will
   be reported and included in the exception.

   The detected cycle can be accessed via the second element in the :attr:`~BaseException.args`
   attribute of the exception instance and consists in a list of nodes, such that each node is,
   in the graph, an immediate predecessor of the next node in the list. In the reported list,
   the first and the last node will be the same, to make it clear that it is cyclic.

:mod:`!grp` --- The group database
==================================

.. module:: grp
   :platform: Unix
   :synopsis: The group database (getgrnam() and friends).

--------------

This module provides access to the Unix group database. It is available on all
Unix versions.

.. availability:: Unix, not WASI, not Android, not iOS.

Group database entries are reported as a tuple-like object, whose attributes
correspond to the members of the ``group`` structure (Attribute field below, see
``<grp.h>``):

+-------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| Index | Attribute | Meaning                         |
+=======+===========+=================================+
| 0     | gr_name   | the name of the group           |
+-------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| 1     | gr_passwd | the (encrypted) group password; |
|       |           | often empty                     |
+-------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| 2     | gr_gid    | the numerical group ID          |
+-------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| 3     | gr_mem    | all the group member's  user    |
|       |           | names                           |
+-------+-----------+---------------------------------+

The gid is an integer, name and password are strings, and the member list is a
list of strings. (Note that most users are not explicitly listed as members of
the group they are in according to the password database.  Check both databases
to get complete membership information.  Also note that a ``gr_name`` that
starts with a ``+`` or ``-`` is likely to be a YP/NIS reference and may not be
accessible via :func:`getgrnam` or :func:`getgrgid`.)

It defines the following items:


.. function:: getgrgid(id)

   Return the group database entry for the given numeric group ID. :exc:`KeyError`
   is raised if the entry asked for cannot be found.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10
      :exc:`TypeError` is raised for non-integer arguments like floats or strings.

.. function:: getgrnam(name)

   Return the group database entry for the given group name. :exc:`KeyError` is
   raised if the entry asked for cannot be found.


.. function:: getgrall()

   Return a list of all available group entries, in arbitrary order.

:mod:`!gzip` --- Support for :program:`gzip` files
==================================================

.. module:: gzip
   :synopsis: Interfaces for gzip compression and decompression using file objects.

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/gzip.py`

--------------

This module provides a simple interface to compress and decompress files just
like the GNU programs :program:`gzip` and :program:`gunzip` would.

The data compression is provided by the :mod:`zlib` module.

The :mod:`gzip` module provides the :class:`GzipFile` class, as well as the
:func:`.open`, :func:`compress` and :func:`decompress` convenience functions.
The :class:`GzipFile` class reads and writes :program:`gzip`\ -format files,
automatically compressing or decompressing the data so that it looks like an
ordinary :term:`file object`.

Note that additional file formats which can be decompressed by the
:program:`gzip` and :program:`gunzip` programs, such  as those produced by
:program:`compress` and :program:`pack`, are not supported by this module.

The module defines the following items:


.. function:: open(filename, mode='rb', compresslevel=9, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None)

   Open a gzip-compressed file in binary or text mode, returning a :term:`file
   object`.

   The *filename* argument can be an actual filename (a :class:`str` or
   :class:`bytes` object), or an existing file object to read from or write to.

   The *mode* argument can be any of ``'r'``, ``'rb'``, ``'a'``, ``'ab'``,
   ``'w'``, ``'wb'``, ``'x'`` or ``'xb'`` for binary mode, or ``'rt'``,
   ``'at'``, ``'wt'``, or ``'xt'`` for text mode. The default is ``'rb'``.

   The *compresslevel* argument is an integer from 0 to 9, as for the
   :class:`GzipFile` constructor.

   For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the :class:`GzipFile`
   constructor: ``GzipFile(filename, mode, compresslevel)``. In this case, the
   *encoding*, *errors* and *newline* arguments must not be provided.

   For text mode, a :class:`GzipFile` object is created, and wrapped in an
   :class:`io.TextIOWrapper` instance with the specified encoding, error
   handling behavior, and line ending(s).

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      Added support for *filename* being a file object, support for text mode,
      and the *encoding*, *errors* and *newline* arguments.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      Added support for the ``'x'``, ``'xb'`` and ``'xt'`` modes.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6
      Accepts a :term:`path-like object`.

.. exception:: BadGzipFile

   An exception raised for invalid gzip files.  It inherits from :exc:`OSError`.
   :exc:`EOFError` and :exc:`zlib.error` can also be raised for invalid gzip
   files.

   .. versionadded:: 3.8

.. class:: GzipFile(filename=None, mode=None, compresslevel=9, fileobj=None, mtime=None)

   Constructor for the :class:`GzipFile` class, which simulates most of the
   methods of a :term:`file object`, with the exception of the :meth:`~io.IOBase.truncate`
   method.  At least one of *fileobj* and *filename* must be given a non-trivial
   value.

   The new class instance is based on *fileobj*, which can be a regular file, an
   :class:`io.BytesIO` object, or any other object which simulates a file.  It
   defaults to ``None``, in which case *filename* is opened to provide a file
   object.

   When *fileobj* is not ``None``, the *filename* argument is only used to be
   included in the :program:`gzip` file header, which may include the original
   filename of the uncompressed file.  It defaults to the filename of *fileobj*, if
   discernible; otherwise, it defaults to the empty string, and in this case the
   original filename is not included in the header.

   The *mode* argument can be any of ``'r'``, ``'rb'``, ``'a'``, ``'ab'``, ``'w'``,
   ``'wb'``, ``'x'``, or ``'xb'``, depending on whether the file will be read or
   written.  The default is the mode of *fileobj* if discernible; otherwise, the
   default is ``'rb'``.  In future Python releases the mode of *fileobj* will
   not be used.  It is better to always specify *mode* for writing.

   Note that the file is always opened in binary mode. To open a compressed file
   in text mode, use :func:`.open` (or wrap your :class:`GzipFile` with an
   :class:`io.TextIOWrapper`).

   The *compresslevel* argument is an integer from ``0`` to ``9`` controlling
   the level of compression; ``1`` is fastest and produces the least
   compression, and ``9`` is slowest and produces the most compression. ``0``
   is no compression. The default is ``9``.

   The optional *mtime* argument is the timestamp requested by gzip. The time
   is in Unix format, i.e., seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970.
   If *mtime* is omitted or ``None``, the current time is used. Use *mtime* = 0
   to generate a compressed stream that does not depend on creation time.

   See below for the :attr:`mtime` attribute that is set when decompressing.

   Calling a :class:`GzipFile` object's :meth:`!close` method does not close
   *fileobj*, since you might wish to append more material after the compressed
   data.  This also allows you to pass an :class:`io.BytesIO` object opened for
   writing as *fileobj*, and retrieve the resulting memory buffer using the
   :class:`io.BytesIO` object's :meth:`~io.BytesIO.getvalue` method.

   :class:`GzipFile` supports the :class:`io.BufferedIOBase` interface,
   including iteration and the :keyword:`with` statement.  Only the
   :meth:`~io.IOBase.truncate` method isn't implemented.

   :class:`GzipFile` also provides the following method and attribute:

   .. method:: peek(n)

      Read *n* uncompressed bytes without advancing the file position.
      At most one single read on the compressed stream is done to satisfy
      the call.  The number of bytes returned may be more or less than
      requested.

      .. note:: While calling :meth:`peek` does not change the file position of
         the :class:`GzipFile`, it may change the position of the underlying
         file object (e.g. if the :class:`GzipFile` was constructed with the
         *fileobj* parameter).

      .. versionadded:: 3.2

   .. attribute:: mode

      ``'rb'`` for reading and ``'wb'`` for writing.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.13
         In previous versions it was an integer ``1`` or ``2``.

   .. attribute:: mtime

      When decompressing, this attribute is set to the last timestamp in the most
      recently read header.  It is an integer, holding the number of seconds
      since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970).
      The initial value before reading any headers is ``None``.

   .. attribute:: name

      The path to the gzip file on disk, as a :class:`str` or :class:`bytes`.
      Equivalent to the output of :func:`os.fspath` on the original input path,
      with no other normalization, resolution or expansion.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.1
      Support for the :keyword:`with` statement was added, along with the
      *mtime* constructor argument and :attr:`mtime` attribute.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2
      Support for zero-padded and unseekable files was added.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      The :meth:`io.BufferedIOBase.read1` method is now implemented.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      Added support for the ``'x'`` and ``'xb'`` modes.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Added support for writing arbitrary
      :term:`bytes-like objects <bytes-like object>`.
      The :meth:`~io.BufferedIOBase.read` method now accepts an argument of
      ``None``.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6
      Accepts a :term:`path-like object`.

   .. deprecated:: 3.9
      Opening :class:`GzipFile` for writing without specifying the *mode*
      argument is deprecated.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.12
      Remove the ``filename`` attribute, use the :attr:`~GzipFile.name`
      attribute instead.


.. function:: compress(data, compresslevel=9, *, mtime=0)

   Compress the *data*, returning a :class:`bytes` object containing
   the compressed data.  *compresslevel* and *mtime* have the same meaning as in
   the :class:`GzipFile` constructor above,
   but *mtime* defaults to 0 for reproducible output.

   .. versionadded:: 3.2
   .. versionchanged:: 3.8
      Added the *mtime* parameter for reproducible output.
   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      Speed is improved by compressing all data at once instead of in a
      streamed fashion. Calls with *mtime* set to ``0`` are delegated to
      :func:`zlib.compress` for better speed. In this situation the
      output may contain a gzip header "OS" byte value other than 255
      "unknown" as supplied by the underlying zlib implementation.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.13
      The gzip header OS byte is guaranteed to be set to 255 when this function
      is used as was the case in 3.10 and earlier.
   .. versionchanged:: 3.14
      The *mtime* parameter now defaults to 0 for reproducible output.
      For the previous behaviour of using the current time,
      pass ``None`` to *mtime*.

.. function:: decompress(data)

   Decompress the *data*, returning a :class:`bytes` object containing the
   uncompressed data. This function is capable of decompressing multi-member
   gzip data (multiple gzip blocks concatenated together). When the data is
   certain to contain only one member the :func:`zlib.decompress` function with
   *wbits* set to 31 is faster.

   .. versionadded:: 3.2
   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      Speed is improved by decompressing members at once in memory instead of in
      a streamed fashion.

   import hashlib


--------------

This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and
message digest algorithms.  Included are the FIPS secure hash algorithms SHA1,
SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, (defined in `the FIPS 180-4 standard`_),
the SHA-3 series (defined in `the FIPS 202 standard`_) as well as RSA's MD5
algorithm (defined in internet :rfc:`1321`).  The terms "secure hash" and
"message digest" are interchangeable.  Older algorithms were called message
digests.  The modern term is secure hash.

.. note::

   If you want the adler32 or crc32 hash functions, they are available in
   the :mod:`zlib` module.


.. _hash-algorithms:

Hash algorithms
---------------

There is one constructor method named for each type of :dfn:`hash`.  All return
a hash object with the same simple interface. For example: use :func:`sha256`
to create a SHA-256 hash object. You can now feed this object with
:term:`bytes-like objects <bytes-like object>` (normally :class:`bytes`) using
the :meth:`update<hash.update>` method.  At any point you can ask it for the
:dfn:`digest` of the concatenation of the data fed to it so far using the
:meth:`digest()<hash.digest>` or :meth:`hexdigest()<hash.hexdigest>` methods.

To allow multithreading, the Python :term:`GIL` is released while computing a
hash supplied more than 2047 bytes of data at once in its constructor or
:meth:`.update<hash.update>` method.


.. index:: single: OpenSSL; (use in module hashlib)

Constructors for hash algorithms that are always present in this module are
:func:`sha1`, :func:`sha224`, :func:`sha256`, :func:`sha384`, :func:`sha512`,
:func:`sha3_224`, :func:`sha3_256`, :func:`sha3_384`, :func:`sha3_512`,
:func:`shake_128`, :func:`shake_256`, :func:`blake2b`, and :func:`blake2s`.
:func:`md5` is normally available as well, though it may be missing or blocked
if you are using a rare "FIPS compliant" build of Python.
These correspond to :data:`algorithms_guaranteed`.

Additional algorithms may also be available if your Python distribution's
:mod:`hashlib` was linked against a build of OpenSSL that provides others.
Others *are not guaranteed available* on all installations and will only be
accessible by name via :func:`new`.  See :data:`algorithms_available`.

.. warning::

   Some algorithms have known hash collision weaknesses (including MD5 and
   SHA1). Refer to `Attacks on cryptographic hash algorithms`_ and the
   `hashlib-seealso`_ section at the end of this document.

.. versionadded:: 3.6
   SHA3 (Keccak) and SHAKE constructors :func:`sha3_224`, :func:`sha3_256`,
   :func:`sha3_384`, :func:`sha3_512`, :func:`shake_128`, :func:`shake_256`
   were added.
   :func:`blake2b` and :func:`blake2s` were added.

.. _hashlib-usedforsecurity:

.. versionchanged:: 3.9
   All hashlib constructors take a keyword-only argument *usedforsecurity*
   with default value ``True``. A false value allows the use of insecure and
   blocked hashing algorithms in restricted environments. ``False`` indicates
   that the hashing algorithm is not used in a security context, e.g. as a
   non-cryptographic one-way compression function.

.. versionchanged:: 3.9
   Hashlib now uses SHA3 and SHAKE from OpenSSL if it provides it.

.. versionchanged:: 3.12
   For any of the MD5, SHA1, SHA2, or SHA3 algorithms that the linked
   OpenSSL does not provide we fall back to a verified implementation from
   the `HACL\* project`_.

Usage
-----

To obtain the digest of the byte string ``b"Nobody inspects the spammish
repetition"``::

   >>> import hashlib
   >>> m = hashlib.sha256()
   >>> m.update(b"Nobody inspects")
   >>> m.update(b" the spammish repetition")
   >>> m.digest()
   b'\x03\x1e\xdd}Ae\x15\x93\xc5\xfe\\\x00o\xa5u+7\xfd\xdf\xf7\xbcN\x84:\xa6\xaf\x0c\x95\x0fK\x94\x06'
   >>> m.hexdigest()
   '031edd7d41651593c5fe5c006fa5752b37fddff7bc4e843aa6af0c950f4b9406'

More condensed:

   >>> hashlib.sha256(b"Nobody inspects the spammish repetition").hexdigest()
   '031edd7d41651593c5fe5c006fa5752b37fddff7bc4e843aa6af0c950f4b9406'

Constructors
------------

.. function:: new(name[, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)

   Is a generic constructor that takes the string *name* of the desired
   algorithm as its first parameter.  It also exists to allow access to the
   above listed hashes as well as any other algorithms that your OpenSSL
   library may offer.

Using :func:`new` with an algorithm name:

   >>> h = hashlib.new('sha256')
   >>> h.update(b"Nobody inspects the spammish repetition")
   >>> h.hexdigest()
   '031edd7d41651593c5fe5c006fa5752b37fddff7bc4e843aa6af0c950f4b9406'


.. function:: md5([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha1([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha224([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha256([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha384([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha512([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha3_224([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha3_256([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha3_384([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha3_512([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)

Named constructors such as these are faster than passing an algorithm name to
:func:`new`.

Attributes
----------

Hashlib provides the following constant module attributes:

.. data:: algorithms_guaranteed

   A set containing the names of the hash algorithms guaranteed to be supported
   by this module on all platforms.  Note that 'md5' is in this list despite
   some upstream vendors offering an odd "FIPS compliant" Python build that
   excludes it.

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

.. data:: algorithms_available

   A set containing the names of the hash algorithms that are available in the
   running Python interpreter.  These names will be recognized when passed to
   :func:`new`.  :attr:`algorithms_guaranteed` will always be a subset.  The
   same algorithm may appear multiple times in this set under different names
   (thanks to OpenSSL).

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

Hash Objects
------------

The following values are provided as constant attributes of the hash objects
returned by the constructors:

.. data:: hash.digest_size

   The size of the resulting hash in bytes.

.. data:: hash.block_size

   The internal block size of the hash algorithm in bytes.

A hash object has the following attributes:

.. attribute:: hash.name

   The canonical name of this hash, always lowercase and always suitable as a
   parameter to :func:`new` to create another hash of this type.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      The name attribute has been present in CPython since its inception, but
      until Python 3.4 was not formally specified, so may not exist on some
      platforms.

A hash object has the following methods:


.. method:: hash.update(data)

   Update the hash object with the :term:`bytes-like object`.
   Repeated calls are equivalent to a single call with the
   concatenation of all the arguments: ``m.update(a); m.update(b)`` is
   equivalent to ``m.update(a+b)``.


.. method:: hash.digest()

   Return the digest of the data passed to the :meth:`update` method so far.
   This is a bytes object of size :attr:`digest_size` which may contain bytes in
   the whole range from 0 to 255.


.. method:: hash.hexdigest()

   Like :meth:`digest` except the digest is returned as a string object of
   double length, containing only hexadecimal digits.  This may be used to
   exchange the value safely in email or other non-binary environments.


.. method:: hash.copy()

   Return a copy ("clone") of the hash object.  This can be used to efficiently
   compute the digests of data sharing a common initial substring.


SHAKE variable length digests
-----------------------------

.. function:: shake_128([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: shake_256([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)

The :func:`shake_128` and :func:`shake_256` algorithms provide variable
length digests with length_in_bits//2 up to 128 or 256 bits of security.
As such, their digest methods require a length. Maximum length is not limited
by the SHAKE algorithm.

.. method:: shake.digest(length)

   Return the digest of the data passed to the :meth:`~hash.update` method so far.
   This is a bytes object of size *length* which may contain bytes in
   the whole range from 0 to 255.


.. method:: shake.hexdigest(length)

   Like :meth:`digest` except the digest is returned as a string object of
   double length, containing only hexadecimal digits.  This may be used to
   exchange the value in email or other non-binary environments.

Example use:

   >>> h = hashlib.shake_256(b'Nobody inspects the spammish repetition')
   >>> h.hexdigest(20)
   '44709d6fcb83d92a76dcb0b668c98e1b1d3dafe7'

File hashing
------------

The hashlib module provides a helper function for efficient hashing of
a file or file-like object.

.. function:: file_digest(fileobj, digest, /)

   Return a digest object that has been updated with contents of file object.

   *fileobj* must be a file-like object opened for reading in binary mode.
   It accepts file objects from  builtin :func:`open`, :class:`~io.BytesIO`
   instances, SocketIO objects from :meth:`socket.socket.makefile`, and
   similar. The function may bypass Python's I/O and use the file descriptor
   from :meth:`~io.IOBase.fileno` directly. *fileobj* must be assumed to be
   in an unknown state after this function returns or raises. It is up to
   the caller to close *fileobj*.

   *digest* must either be a hash algorithm name as a *str*, a hash
   constructor, or a callable that returns a hash object.

   Example:

      >>> import io, hashlib, hmac
      >>> with open(hashlib.__file__, "rb") as f:
      ...     digest = hashlib.file_digest(f, "sha256")
      ...
      >>> digest.hexdigest()  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
      '...'

      >>> buf = io.BytesIO(b"somedata")
      >>> mac1 = hmac.HMAC(b"key", digestmod=hashlib.sha512)
      >>> digest = hashlib.file_digest(buf, lambda: mac1)

      >>> digest is mac1
      True
      >>> mac2 = hmac.HMAC(b"key", b"somedata", digestmod=hashlib.sha512)
      >>> mac1.digest() == mac2.digest()
      True

   .. versionadded:: 3.11


Key derivation
--------------

Key derivation and key stretching algorithms are designed for secure password
hashing. Naive algorithms such as ``sha1(password)`` are not resistant against
brute-force attacks. A good password hashing function must be tunable, slow, and
include a `salt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29>`_.
