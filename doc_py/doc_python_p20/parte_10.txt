   of all file names, in the order in which they appear in the languages list or
   the environment variables.


.. function:: translation(domain, localedir=None, languages=None, class_=None, fallback=False)

   Return a ``*Translations`` instance based on the *domain*, *localedir*,
   and *languages*, which are first passed to :func:`find` to get a list of the
   associated :file:`.mo` file paths.  Instances with identical :file:`.mo` file
   names are cached.  The actual class instantiated is *class_* if
   provided, otherwise :class:`GNUTranslations`.  The class's constructor must
   take a single :term:`file object` argument.

   If multiple files are found, later files are used as fallbacks for earlier ones.
   To allow setting the fallback, :func:`copy.copy` is used to clone each
   translation object from the cache; the actual instance data is still shared with
   the cache.

   If no :file:`.mo` file is found, this function raises :exc:`OSError` if
   *fallback* is false (which is the default), and returns a
   :class:`NullTranslations` instance if *fallback* is true.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      :exc:`IOError` used to be raised, it is now an alias of :exc:`OSError`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      *codeset* parameter is removed.

.. function:: install(domain, localedir=None, *, names=None)

   This installs the function :func:`!_` in Python's builtins namespace, based on
   *domain* and *localedir* which are passed to the function :func:`translation`.

   For the *names* parameter, please see the description of the translation
   object's :meth:`~NullTranslations.install` method.

   As seen below, you usually mark the strings in your application that are
   candidates for translation, by wrapping them in a call to the :func:`!_`
   function, like this::

      print(_('This string will be translated.'))

   For convenience, you want the :func:`!_` function to be installed in Python's
   builtins namespace, so it is easily accessible in all modules of your
   application.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      *names* is now a keyword-only parameter.

The :class:`NullTranslations` class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Translation classes are what actually implement the translation of original
source file message strings to translated message strings. The base class used
by all translation classes is :class:`NullTranslations`; this provides the basic
interface you can use to write your own specialized translation classes.  Here
are the methods of :class:`!NullTranslations`:


.. class:: NullTranslations(fp=None)

   Takes an optional :term:`file object` *fp*, which is ignored by the base class.
   Initializes "protected" instance variables *_info* and *_charset* which are set
   by derived classes, as well as *_fallback*, which is set through
   :meth:`add_fallback`.  It then calls ``self._parse(fp)`` if *fp* is not
   ``None``.

   .. method:: _parse(fp)

      No-op in the base class, this method takes file object *fp*, and reads
      the data from the file, initializing its message catalog.  If you have an
      unsupported message catalog file format, you should override this method
      to parse your format.


   .. method:: add_fallback(fallback)

      Add *fallback* as the fallback object for the current translation object.
      A translation object should consult the fallback if it cannot provide a
      translation for a given message.


   .. method:: gettext(message)

      If a fallback has been set, forward :meth:`!gettext` to the fallback.
      Otherwise, return *message*.  Overridden in derived classes.


   .. method:: ngettext(singular, plural, n)

      If a fallback has been set, forward :meth:`!ngettext` to the fallback.
      Otherwise, return *singular* if *n* is 1; return *plural* otherwise.
      Overridden in derived classes.


   .. method:: pgettext(context, message)

      If a fallback has been set, forward :meth:`pgettext` to the fallback.
      Otherwise, return the translated message.  Overridden in derived classes.

      .. versionadded:: 3.8


   .. method:: npgettext(context, singular, plural, n)

      If a fallback has been set, forward :meth:`npgettext` to the fallback.
      Otherwise, return the translated message.  Overridden in derived classes.

      .. versionadded:: 3.8


   .. method:: info()

      Return a dictionary containing
      the metadata found in the message catalog file.


   .. method:: charset()

      Return the encoding of the message catalog file.


   .. method:: install(names=None)

      This method installs :meth:`.gettext` into the built-in namespace,
      binding it to ``_``.

      If the *names* parameter is given, it must be a sequence containing the
      names of functions you want to install in the builtins namespace in
      addition to :func:`!_`.  Supported names are ``'gettext'``, ``'ngettext'``,
      ``'pgettext'``, and ``'npgettext'``.

      Note that this is only one way, albeit the most convenient way, to make
      the :func:`!_` function available to your application.  Because it affects
      the entire application globally, and specifically the built-in namespace,
      localized modules should never install :func:`!_`. Instead, they should use
      this code to make :func:`!_` available to their module::

         import gettext
         t = gettext.translation('mymodule', ...)
         _ = t.gettext

      This puts :func:`!_` only in the module's global namespace and so only
      affects calls within this module.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.8
         Added ``'pgettext'`` and ``'npgettext'``.


The :class:`GNUTranslations` class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :mod:`!gettext` module provides one additional class derived from
:class:`NullTranslations`: :class:`GNUTranslations`.  This class overrides
:meth:`!_parse` to enable reading GNU :program:`gettext` format :file:`.mo` files
in both big-endian and little-endian format.

:class:`GNUTranslations` parses optional metadata out of the translation
catalog. It is convention with GNU :program:`gettext` to include metadata as
the translation for the empty string. This metadata is in :rfc:`822`\ -style
``key: value`` pairs, and should contain the ``Project-Id-Version`` key.  If the
key ``Content-Type`` is found, then the ``charset`` property is used to
initialize the "protected" :attr:`!_charset` instance variable, defaulting to
``None`` if not found.  If the charset encoding is specified, then all message
ids and message strings read from the catalog are converted to Unicode using
this encoding, else ASCII is assumed.

Since message ids are read as Unicode strings too, all ``*gettext()`` methods
will assume message ids as Unicode strings, not byte strings.

The entire set of key/value pairs are placed into a dictionary and set as the
"protected" :attr:`!_info` instance variable.

If the :file:`.mo` file's magic number is invalid, the major version number is
unexpected, or if other problems occur while reading the file, instantiating a
:class:`GNUTranslations` class can raise :exc:`OSError`.

.. class:: GNUTranslations

   The following methods are overridden from the base class implementation:

   .. method:: gettext(message)

      Look up the *message* id in the catalog and return the corresponding message
      string, as a Unicode string.  If there is no entry in the catalog for the
      *message* id, and a fallback has been set, the look up is forwarded to the
      fallback's :meth:`~NullTranslations.gettext` method.  Otherwise, the
      *message* id is returned.


   .. method:: ngettext(singular, plural, n)

      Do a plural-forms lookup of a message id.  *singular* is used as the message id
      for purposes of lookup in the catalog, while *n* is used to determine which
      plural form to use.  The returned message string is a Unicode string.

      If the message id is not found in the catalog, and a fallback is specified,
      the request is forwarded to the fallback's :meth:`~NullTranslations.ngettext`
      method.  Otherwise, when *n* is 1 *singular* is returned, and *plural* is
      returned in all other cases.

      Here is an example::

         n = len(os.listdir('.'))
         cat = GNUTranslations(somefile)
         message = cat.ngettext(
             'There is %(num)d file in this directory',
             'There are %(num)d files in this directory',
             n) % {'num': n}


   .. method:: pgettext(context, message)

      Look up the *context* and *message* id in the catalog and return the
      corresponding message string, as a Unicode string.  If there is no
      entry in the catalog for the *message* id and *context*, and a fallback
      has been set, the look up is forwarded to the fallback's
      :meth:`pgettext` method.  Otherwise, the *message* id is returned.

      .. versionadded:: 3.8


   .. method:: npgettext(context, singular, plural, n)

      Do a plural-forms lookup of a message id.  *singular* is used as the
      message id for purposes of lookup in the catalog, while *n* is used to
      determine which plural form to use.

      If the message id for *context* is not found in the catalog, and a
      fallback is specified, the request is forwarded to the fallback's
      :meth:`npgettext` method.  Otherwise, when *n* is 1 *singular* is
      returned, and *plural* is returned in all other cases.

      .. versionadded:: 3.8


Solaris message catalog support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Solaris operating system defines its own binary :file:`.mo` file format, but
since no documentation can be found on this format, it is not supported at this
time.


The Catalog constructor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: single: GNOME

GNOME uses a version of the :mod:`gettext` module by James Henstridge, but this
version has a slightly different API.  Its documented usage was::

   import gettext
   cat = gettext.Catalog(domain, localedir)
   _ = cat.gettext
   print(_('hello world'))

For compatibility with this older module, the function :func:`!Catalog` is an
alias for the :func:`translation` function described above.

One difference between this module and Henstridge's: his catalog objects
supported access through a mapping API, but this appears to be unused and so is
not currently supported.

.. _i18n-howto:

Internationalizing your programs and modules
--------------------------------------------

Internationalization (I18N) refers to the operation by which a program is made
aware of multiple languages.  Localization (L10N) refers to the adaptation of
your program, once internationalized, to the local language and cultural habits.
In order to provide multilingual messages for your Python programs, you need to
take the following steps:

#. prepare your program or module by specially marking translatable strings

#. run a suite of tools over your marked files to generate raw messages catalogs

#. create language-specific translations of the message catalogs

#. use the :mod:`gettext` module so that message strings are properly translated

In order to prepare your code for I18N, you need to look at all the strings in
your files.  Any string that needs to be translated should be marked by wrapping
it in ``_('...')`` --- that is, a call to the function :func:`_ <gettext>`.  For example::

   filename = 'mylog.txt'
   message = _('writing a log message')
   with open(filename, 'w') as fp:
       fp.write(message)

In this example, the string ``'writing a log message'`` is marked as a candidate
for translation, while the strings ``'mylog.txt'`` and ``'w'`` are not.

There are a few tools to extract the strings meant for translation.
The original GNU :program:`gettext` only supported C or C++ source
code but its extended version :program:`xgettext` scans code written
in a number of languages, including Python, to find strings marked as
translatable.  `Babel <https://babel.pocoo.org/>`__ is a Python
internationalization library that includes a :file:`pybabel` script to
extract and compile message catalogs.  François Pinard's program
called :program:`xpot` does a similar job and is available as part of
his `po-utils package <https://github.com/pinard/po-utils>`__.

(Python also includes pure-Python versions of these programs, called
:program:`pygettext.py` and :program:`msgfmt.py`; some Python distributions
will install them for you.  :program:`pygettext.py` is similar to
:program:`xgettext`, but only understands Python source code and
cannot handle other programming languages such as C or C++.
:program:`pygettext.py` supports a command-line interface similar to
:program:`xgettext`; for details on its use, run ``pygettext.py
--help``.  :program:`msgfmt.py` is binary compatible with GNU
:program:`msgfmt`.  With these two programs, you may not need the GNU
:program:`gettext` package to internationalize your Python
applications.)

:program:`xgettext`, :program:`pygettext`, and similar tools generate
:file:`.po` files that are message catalogs.  They are structured
human-readable files that contain every marked string in the source
code, along with a placeholder for the translated versions of these
strings.

Copies of these :file:`.po` files are then handed over to the
individual human translators who write translations for every
supported natural language.  They send back the completed
language-specific versions as a :file:`<language-name>.po` file that's
compiled into a machine-readable :file:`.mo` binary catalog file using
the :program:`msgfmt` program.  The :file:`.mo` files are used by the
:mod:`gettext` module for the actual translation processing at
run-time.

How you use the :mod:`gettext` module in your code depends on whether you are
internationalizing a single module or your entire application. The next two
sections will discuss each case.


Localizing your module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are localizing your module, you must take care not to make global
changes, e.g. to the built-in namespace. You should not use the GNU :program:`gettext`
API but instead the class-based API.

Let's say your module is called "spam" and the module's various natural language
translation :file:`.mo` files reside in :file:`/usr/share/locale` in GNU
:program:`gettext` format.  Here's what you would put at the top of your
module::

   import gettext
   t = gettext.translation('spam', '/usr/share/locale')
   _ = t.gettext


Localizing your application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are localizing your application, you can install the :func:`!_` function
globally into the built-in namespace, usually in the main driver file of your
application.  This will let all your application-specific files just use
``_('...')`` without having to explicitly install it in each file.

In the simple case then, you need only add the following bit of code to the main
driver file of your application::

   import gettext
   gettext.install('myapplication')

If you need to set the locale directory, you can pass it into the
:func:`install` function::

   import gettext
   gettext.install('myapplication', '/usr/share/locale')


Changing languages on the fly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your program needs to support many languages at the same time, you may want
to create multiple translation instances and then switch between them
explicitly, like so::

   import gettext

   lang1 = gettext.translation('myapplication', languages=['en'])
   lang2 = gettext.translation('myapplication', languages=['fr'])
   lang3 = gettext.translation('myapplication', languages=['de'])

   # start by using language1
   lang1.install()

   # ... time goes by, user selects language 2
   lang2.install()

   # ... more time goes by, user selects language 3
   lang3.install()


Deferred translations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In most coding situations, strings are translated where they are coded.
Occasionally however, you need to mark strings for translation, but defer actual
translation until later.  A classic example is::

   animals = ['mollusk',
              'albatross',
              'rat',
              'penguin',
              'python', ]
   # ...
   for a in animals:
       print(a)

Here, you want to mark the strings in the ``animals`` list as being
translatable, but you don't actually want to translate them until they are
printed.

Here is one way you can handle this situation::

   def _(message): return message

   animals = [_('mollusk'),
              _('albatross'),
              _('rat'),
              _('penguin'),
              _('python'), ]

   del _

   # ...
   for a in animals:
       print(_(a))

This works because the dummy definition of :func:`!_` simply returns the string
unchanged.  And this dummy definition will temporarily override any definition
of :func:`!_` in the built-in namespace (until the :keyword:`del` command). Take
care, though if you have a previous definition of :func:`!_` in the local
namespace.

Note that the second use of :func:`!_` will not identify "a" as being
translatable to the :program:`gettext` program, because the parameter
is not a string literal.

Another way to handle this is with the following example::

   def N_(message): return message

   animals = [N_('mollusk'),
              N_('albatross'),
              N_('rat'),
              N_('penguin'),
              N_('python'), ]

   # ...
   for a in animals:
       print(_(a))

In this case, you are marking translatable strings with the function
:func:`!N_`, which won't conflict with any definition of :func:`!_`.
However, you will need to teach your message extraction program to
look for translatable strings marked with :func:`!N_`. :program:`xgettext`,
:program:`pygettext`, ``pybabel extract``, and :program:`xpot` all
support this through the use of the :option:`!-k` command-line switch.
The choice of :func:`!N_` here is totally arbitrary; it could have just
as easily been :func:`!MarkThisStringForTranslation`.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] The default locale directory is system dependent; for example, on Red Hat Linux
   it is :file:`/usr/share/locale`, but on Solaris it is :file:`/usr/lib/locale`.
   The :mod:`!gettext` module does not try to support these system dependent
   defaults; instead its default is :file:`{sys.base_prefix}/share/locale` (see
   :data:`sys.base_prefix`). For this reason, it is always best to call
   :func:`bindtextdomain` with an explicit absolute path at the start of your
   application.

:mod:`!glob` --- Unix style pathname pattern expansion
======================================================

.. module:: glob
   :synopsis: Unix shell style pathname pattern expansion.

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/glob.py`

.. index:: single: filenames; pathname expansion

--------------

.. index::
   single: * (asterisk); in glob-style wildcards
   single: ? (question mark); in glob-style wildcards
   single: [] (square brackets); in glob-style wildcards
   single: ! (exclamation); in glob-style wildcards
   single: - (minus); in glob-style wildcards
   single: . (dot); in glob-style wildcards

The :mod:`glob` module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern
according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned in
arbitrary order.  No tilde expansion is done, but ``*``, ``?``, and character
ranges expressed with ``[]`` will be correctly matched.  This is done by using
the :func:`os.scandir` and :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` functions in concert, and
not by actually invoking a subshell.

Note that files beginning with a dot (``.``) can only be matched by
patterns that also start with a dot,
unlike :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` or :func:`pathlib.Path.glob`.
(For tilde and shell variable expansion, use :func:`os.path.expanduser` and
:func:`os.path.expandvars`.)

For a literal match, wrap the meta-characters in brackets.
For example, ``'[?]'`` matches the character ``'?'``.

The :mod:`glob` module defines the following functions:


.. function:: glob(pathname, *, root_dir=None, dir_fd=None, recursive=False, \
                   include_hidden=False)

   Return a possibly empty list of path names that match *pathname*, which must be
   a string containing a path specification. *pathname* can be either absolute
   (like :file:`/usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile`) or relative (like
   :file:`../../Tools/\*/\*.gif`), and can contain shell-style wildcards. Broken
   symlinks are included in the results (as in the shell). Whether or not the
   results are sorted depends on the file system.  If a file that satisfies
   conditions is removed or added during the call of this function, whether
   a path name for that file will be included is unspecified.

   If *root_dir* is not ``None``, it should be a :term:`path-like object`
   specifying the root directory for searching.  It has the same effect on
   :func:`glob` as changing the current directory before calling it.  If
   *pathname* is relative, the result will contain paths relative to
   *root_dir*.

   This function can support :ref:`paths relative to directory descriptors
   <dir_fd>` with the *dir_fd* parameter.

   .. index::
      single: **; in glob-style wildcards

   If *recursive* is true, the pattern "``**``" will match any files and zero or
   more directories, subdirectories and symbolic links to directories. If the
   pattern is followed by an :data:`os.sep` or :data:`os.altsep` then files will not
   match.

   If *include_hidden* is true, "``**``" pattern will match hidden directories.

   .. audit-event:: glob.glob pathname,recursive glob.glob
   .. audit-event:: glob.glob/2 pathname,recursive,root_dir,dir_fd glob.glob

   .. note::
      Using the "``**``" pattern in large directory trees may consume
      an inordinate amount of time.

   .. note::
      This function may return duplicate path names if *pathname*
      contains multiple "``**``" patterns and *recursive* is true.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Support for recursive globs using "``**``".

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10
      Added the *root_dir* and *dir_fd* parameters.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      Added the *include_hidden* parameter.


.. function:: iglob(pathname, *, root_dir=None, dir_fd=None, recursive=False, \
                    include_hidden=False)

   Return an :term:`iterator` which yields the same values as :func:`glob`
   without actually storing them all simultaneously.

   .. audit-event:: glob.glob pathname,recursive glob.iglob
   .. audit-event:: glob.glob/2 pathname,recursive,root_dir,dir_fd glob.iglob

   .. note::
      This function may return duplicate path names if *pathname*
      contains multiple "``**``" patterns and *recursive* is true.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Support for recursive globs using "``**``".

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10
      Added the *root_dir* and *dir_fd* parameters.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      Added the *include_hidden* parameter.


.. function:: escape(pathname)

   Escape all special characters (``'?'``, ``'*'`` and ``'['``).
   This is useful if you want to match an arbitrary literal string that may
   have special characters in it.  Special characters in drive/UNC
   sharepoints are not escaped, e.g. on Windows
   ``escape('//?/c:/Quo vadis?.txt')`` returns ``'//?/c:/Quo vadis[?].txt'``.

   .. versionadded:: 3.4


.. function:: translate(pathname, *, recursive=False, include_hidden=False, seps=None)

   Convert the given path specification to a regular expression for use with
   :func:`re.match`. The path specification can contain shell-style wildcards.

   For example:

      >>> import glob, re
      >>>
      >>> regex = glob.translate('**/*.txt', recursive=True, include_hidden=True)
      >>> regex
      '(?s:(?:.+/)?[^/]*\\.txt)\\Z'
      >>> reobj = re.compile(regex)
      >>> reobj.match('foo/bar/baz.txt')
      <re.Match object; span=(0, 15), match='foo/bar/baz.txt'>

   Path separators and segments are meaningful to this function, unlike
   :func:`fnmatch.translate`. By default wildcards do not match path
   separators, and ``*`` pattern segments match precisely one path segment.

   If *recursive* is true, the pattern segment "``**``" will match any number
   of path segments.

   If *include_hidden* is true, wildcards can match path segments that start
   with a dot (``.``).

   A sequence of path separators may be supplied to the *seps* argument. If
   not given, :data:`os.sep` and :data:`~os.altsep` (if available) are used.

   .. seealso::

     :meth:`pathlib.PurePath.full_match` and :meth:`pathlib.Path.glob`
     methods, which call this function to implement pattern matching and
     globbing.

   .. versionadded:: 3.13


Examples
--------

Consider a directory containing the following files:
:file:`1.gif`, :file:`2.txt`, :file:`card.gif` and a subdirectory :file:`sub`
which contains only the file :file:`3.txt`.  :func:`glob` will produce
the following results.  Notice how any leading components of the path are
preserved. ::

   >>> import glob
   >>> glob.glob('./[0-9].*')
   ['./1.gif', './2.txt']
   >>> glob.glob('*.gif')
   ['1.gif', 'card.gif']
   >>> glob.glob('?.gif')
   ['1.gif']
   >>> glob.glob('**/*.txt', recursive=True)
   ['2.txt', 'sub/3.txt']
   >>> glob.glob('./**/', recursive=True)
   ['./', './sub/']

If the directory contains files starting with ``.`` they won't be matched by
default. For example, consider a directory containing :file:`card.gif` and
:file:`.card.gif`::

   >>> import glob
   >>> glob.glob('*.gif')
   ['card.gif']
   >>> glob.glob('.c*')
   ['.card.gif']

   Provides functionality to topologically sort a graph of :term:`hashable` nodes.

   A topological order is a linear ordering of the vertices in a graph such that
   for every directed edge u -> v from vertex u to vertex v, vertex u comes
   before vertex v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may
   represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that
   one task must be performed before another; in this example, a topological
   ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. A complete topological
   ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that
   is, if it is a directed acyclic graph.

   If the optional *graph* argument is provided it must be a dictionary
   representing a directed acyclic graph where the keys are nodes and the values
   are iterables of all predecessors of that node in the graph (the nodes that
   have edges that point to the value in the key). Additional nodes can be added
   to the graph using the :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.add` method.

   In the general case, the steps required to perform the sorting of a given
   graph are as follows:

   * Create an instance of the :class:`TopologicalSorter` with an optional
     initial graph.
   * Add additional nodes to the graph.
   * Call :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare` on the graph.
   * While :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.is_active` is ``True``, iterate over
     the nodes returned by :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.get_ready` and
     process them. Call :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.done` on each node as it
     finishes processing.

   In case just an immediate sorting of the nodes in the graph is required and
   no parallelism is involved, the convenience method
   :meth:`TopologicalSorter.static_order` can be used directly:

   .. doctest::

       >>> graph = {"D": {"B", "C"}, "C": {"A"}, "B": {"A"}}
       >>> ts = TopologicalSorter(graph)
       >>> tuple(ts.static_order())
       ('A', 'C', 'B', 'D')

   The class is designed to easily support parallel processing of the nodes as
   they become ready. For instance::

       topological_sorter = TopologicalSorter()

       # Add nodes to 'topological_sorter'...

       topological_sorter.prepare()
       while topological_sorter.is_active():
           for node in topological_sorter.get_ready():
               # Worker threads or processes take nodes to work on off the
               # 'task_queue' queue.
               task_queue.put(node)

           # When the work for a node is done, workers put the node in
           # 'finalized_tasks_queue' so we can get more nodes to work on.
           # The definition of 'is_active()' guarantees that, at this point, at
           # least one node has been placed on 'task_queue' that hasn't yet
           # been passed to 'done()', so this blocking 'get()' must (eventually)
           # succeed.  After calling 'done()', we loop back to call 'get_ready()'
           # again, so put newly freed nodes on 'task_queue' as soon as
           # logically possible.
           node = finalized_tasks_queue.get()
           topological_sorter.done(node)

   .. method:: add(node, *predecessors)

      Add a new node and its predecessors to the graph. Both the *node* and all
      elements in *predecessors* must be :term:`hashable`.

      If called multiple times with the same node argument, the set of
      dependencies will be the union of all dependencies passed in.

      It is possible to add a node with no dependencies (*predecessors* is not
      provided) or to provide a dependency twice. If a node that has not been
      provided before is included among *predecessors* it will be automatically
      added to the graph with no predecessors of its own.

      Raises :exc:`ValueError` if called after :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare`.

   .. method:: prepare()

      Mark the graph as finished and check for cycles in the graph. If any cycle
      is detected, :exc:`CycleError` will be raised, but
      :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.get_ready` can still be used to obtain as many
      nodes as possible until cycles block more progress. After a call to this
      function, the graph cannot be modified, and therefore no more nodes can be
      added using :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.add`.

   .. method:: is_active()

      Returns ``True`` if more progress can be made and ``False`` otherwise.
      Progress can be made if cycles do not block the resolution and either
      there are still nodes ready that haven't yet been returned by
      :meth:`TopologicalSorter.get_ready` or the number of nodes marked
      :meth:`TopologicalSorter.done` is less than the number that have been
      returned by :meth:`TopologicalSorter.get_ready`.

      The :meth:`~object.__bool__` method of this class defers to
      this function, so instead of::

          if ts.is_active():
              ...

      it is possible to simply do::

          if ts:
              ...

      Raises :exc:`ValueError` if called without calling
      :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare` previously.

   .. method:: done(*nodes)

      Marks a set of nodes returned by :meth:`TopologicalSorter.get_ready` as
      processed, unblocking any successor of each node in *nodes* for being
      returned in the future by a call to :meth:`TopologicalSorter.get_ready`.

      Raises :exc:`ValueError` if any node in *nodes* has already been marked as
      processed by a previous call to this method or if a node was not added to
      the graph by using :meth:`TopologicalSorter.add`, if called without
      calling :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare` or if node has not yet been
      returned by :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.get_ready`.

   .. method:: get_ready()

      Returns a ``tuple`` with all the nodes that are ready. Initially it
      returns all nodes with no predecessors, and once those are marked as
      processed by calling :meth:`TopologicalSorter.done`, further calls will
      return all new nodes that have all their predecessors already processed.
      Once no more progress can be made, empty tuples are returned.

      Raises :exc:`ValueError` if called without calling
      :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare` previously.

   .. method:: static_order()

      Returns an iterator object which will iterate over nodes in a topological
      order. When using this method, :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare` and
      :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.done` should not be called. This method is
      equivalent to::

          def static_order(self):
              self.prepare()
              while self.is_active():
                  node_group = self.get_ready()
                  yield from node_group
                  self.done(*node_group)

      The particular order that is returned may depend on the specific order in
      which the items were inserted in the graph. For example:

      .. doctest::

          >>> ts = TopologicalSorter()
          >>> ts.add(3, 2, 1)
          >>> ts.add(1, 0)
          >>> print([*ts.static_order()])
          [2, 0, 1, 3]

          >>> ts2 = TopologicalSorter()
          >>> ts2.add(1, 0)
          >>> ts2.add(3, 2, 1)
          >>> print([*ts2.static_order()])
          [0, 2, 1, 3]

      This is due to the fact that "0" and "2" are in the same level in the
      graph (they would have been returned in the same call to
      :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.get_ready`) and the order between them is
      determined by the order of insertion.


      If any cycle is detected, :exc:`CycleError` will be raised.

   .. versionadded:: 3.9


Exceptions
----------
The :mod:`graphlib` module defines the following exception classes:

.. exception:: CycleError

   Subclass of :exc:`ValueError` raised by :meth:`TopologicalSorter.prepare` if cycles exist
   in the working graph. If multiple cycles exist, only one undefined choice among them will
   be reported and included in the exception.

   The detected cycle can be accessed via the second element in the :attr:`~BaseException.args`
   attribute of the exception instance and consists in a list of nodes, such that each node is,
   in the graph, an immediate predecessor of the next node in the list. In the reported list,
   the first and the last node will be the same, to make it clear that it is cyclic.

:mod:`!grp` --- The group database
==================================

.. module:: grp
   :platform: Unix
   :synopsis: The group database (getgrnam() and friends).

--------------

This module provides access to the Unix group database. It is available on all
Unix versions.

.. availability:: Unix, not WASI, not Android, not iOS.

Group database entries are reported as a tuple-like object, whose attributes
correspond to the members of the ``group`` structure (Attribute field below, see
``<grp.h>``):

+-------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| Index | Attribute | Meaning                         |
+=======+===========+=================================+
| 0     | gr_name   | the name of the group           |
+-------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| 1     | gr_passwd | the (encrypted) group password; |
|       |           | often empty                     |
+-------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| 2     | gr_gid    | the numerical group ID          |
+-------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| 3     | gr_mem    | all the group member's  user    |
|       |           | names                           |
+-------+-----------+---------------------------------+

The gid is an integer, name and password are strings, and the member list is a
list of strings. (Note that most users are not explicitly listed as members of
the group they are in according to the password database.  Check both databases
to get complete membership information.  Also note that a ``gr_name`` that
starts with a ``+`` or ``-`` is likely to be a YP/NIS reference and may not be
accessible via :func:`getgrnam` or :func:`getgrgid`.)

It defines the following items:


.. function:: getgrgid(id)

   Return the group database entry for the given numeric group ID. :exc:`KeyError`
   is raised if the entry asked for cannot be found.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10
      :exc:`TypeError` is raised for non-integer arguments like floats or strings.

.. function:: getgrnam(name)

   Return the group database entry for the given group name. :exc:`KeyError` is
   raised if the entry asked for cannot be found.


.. function:: getgrall()

   Return a list of all available group entries, in arbitrary order.

:mod:`!gzip` --- Support for :program:`gzip` files
==================================================

.. module:: gzip
   :synopsis: Interfaces for gzip compression and decompression using file objects.

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/gzip.py`

--------------

This module provides a simple interface to compress and decompress files just
like the GNU programs :program:`gzip` and :program:`gunzip` would.

The data compression is provided by the :mod:`zlib` module.

The :mod:`gzip` module provides the :class:`GzipFile` class, as well as the
:func:`.open`, :func:`compress` and :func:`decompress` convenience functions.
The :class:`GzipFile` class reads and writes :program:`gzip`\ -format files,
automatically compressing or decompressing the data so that it looks like an
ordinary :term:`file object`.

Note that additional file formats which can be decompressed by the
:program:`gzip` and :program:`gunzip` programs, such  as those produced by
:program:`compress` and :program:`pack`, are not supported by this module.

The module defines the following items:


.. function:: open(filename, mode='rb', compresslevel=9, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None)

   Open a gzip-compressed file in binary or text mode, returning a :term:`file
   object`.

   The *filename* argument can be an actual filename (a :class:`str` or
   :class:`bytes` object), or an existing file object to read from or write to.

   The *mode* argument can be any of ``'r'``, ``'rb'``, ``'a'``, ``'ab'``,
   ``'w'``, ``'wb'``, ``'x'`` or ``'xb'`` for binary mode, or ``'rt'``,
   ``'at'``, ``'wt'``, or ``'xt'`` for text mode. The default is ``'rb'``.

   The *compresslevel* argument is an integer from 0 to 9, as for the
   :class:`GzipFile` constructor.

   For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the :class:`GzipFile`
   constructor: ``GzipFile(filename, mode, compresslevel)``. In this case, the
   *encoding*, *errors* and *newline* arguments must not be provided.

   For text mode, a :class:`GzipFile` object is created, and wrapped in an
   :class:`io.TextIOWrapper` instance with the specified encoding, error
   handling behavior, and line ending(s).

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      Added support for *filename* being a file object, support for text mode,
      and the *encoding*, *errors* and *newline* arguments.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      Added support for the ``'x'``, ``'xb'`` and ``'xt'`` modes.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6
      Accepts a :term:`path-like object`.

.. exception:: BadGzipFile

   An exception raised for invalid gzip files.  It inherits from :exc:`OSError`.
   :exc:`EOFError` and :exc:`zlib.error` can also be raised for invalid gzip
   files.

   .. versionadded:: 3.8

.. class:: GzipFile(filename=None, mode=None, compresslevel=9, fileobj=None, mtime=None)

   Constructor for the :class:`GzipFile` class, which simulates most of the
   methods of a :term:`file object`, with the exception of the :meth:`~io.IOBase.truncate`
   method.  At least one of *fileobj* and *filename* must be given a non-trivial
   value.

   The new class instance is based on *fileobj*, which can be a regular file, an
   :class:`io.BytesIO` object, or any other object which simulates a file.  It
   defaults to ``None``, in which case *filename* is opened to provide a file
   object.

   When *fileobj* is not ``None``, the *filename* argument is only used to be
   included in the :program:`gzip` file header, which may include the original
   filename of the uncompressed file.  It defaults to the filename of *fileobj*, if
   discernible; otherwise, it defaults to the empty string, and in this case the
   original filename is not included in the header.

   The *mode* argument can be any of ``'r'``, ``'rb'``, ``'a'``, ``'ab'``, ``'w'``,
   ``'wb'``, ``'x'``, or ``'xb'``, depending on whether the file will be read or
   written.  The default is the mode of *fileobj* if discernible; otherwise, the
   default is ``'rb'``.  In future Python releases the mode of *fileobj* will
   not be used.  It is better to always specify *mode* for writing.

   Note that the file is always opened in binary mode. To open a compressed file
   in text mode, use :func:`.open` (or wrap your :class:`GzipFile` with an
   :class:`io.TextIOWrapper`).

   The *compresslevel* argument is an integer from ``0`` to ``9`` controlling
   the level of compression; ``1`` is fastest and produces the least
   compression, and ``9`` is slowest and produces the most compression. ``0``
   is no compression. The default is ``9``.

   The optional *mtime* argument is the timestamp requested by gzip. The time
   is in Unix format, i.e., seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970.
   If *mtime* is omitted or ``None``, the current time is used. Use *mtime* = 0
   to generate a compressed stream that does not depend on creation time.

   See below for the :attr:`mtime` attribute that is set when decompressing.

   Calling a :class:`GzipFile` object's :meth:`!close` method does not close
   *fileobj*, since you might wish to append more material after the compressed
   data.  This also allows you to pass an :class:`io.BytesIO` object opened for
   writing as *fileobj*, and retrieve the resulting memory buffer using the
   :class:`io.BytesIO` object's :meth:`~io.BytesIO.getvalue` method.

   :class:`GzipFile` supports the :class:`io.BufferedIOBase` interface,
   including iteration and the :keyword:`with` statement.  Only the
   :meth:`~io.IOBase.truncate` method isn't implemented.

   :class:`GzipFile` also provides the following method and attribute:

   .. method:: peek(n)

      Read *n* uncompressed bytes without advancing the file position.
      At most one single read on the compressed stream is done to satisfy
      the call.  The number of bytes returned may be more or less than
      requested.

      .. note:: While calling :meth:`peek` does not change the file position of
         the :class:`GzipFile`, it may change the position of the underlying
         file object (e.g. if the :class:`GzipFile` was constructed with the
         *fileobj* parameter).

      .. versionadded:: 3.2

   .. attribute:: mode

      ``'rb'`` for reading and ``'wb'`` for writing.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.13
         In previous versions it was an integer ``1`` or ``2``.

   .. attribute:: mtime

      When decompressing, this attribute is set to the last timestamp in the most
      recently read header.  It is an integer, holding the number of seconds
      since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970).
      The initial value before reading any headers is ``None``.

   .. attribute:: name

      The path to the gzip file on disk, as a :class:`str` or :class:`bytes`.
      Equivalent to the output of :func:`os.fspath` on the original input path,
      with no other normalization, resolution or expansion.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.1
      Support for the :keyword:`with` statement was added, along with the
      *mtime* constructor argument and :attr:`mtime` attribute.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2
      Support for zero-padded and unseekable files was added.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      The :meth:`io.BufferedIOBase.read1` method is now implemented.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      Added support for the ``'x'`` and ``'xb'`` modes.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Added support for writing arbitrary
      :term:`bytes-like objects <bytes-like object>`.
      The :meth:`~io.BufferedIOBase.read` method now accepts an argument of
      ``None``.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6
      Accepts a :term:`path-like object`.

   .. deprecated:: 3.9
      Opening :class:`GzipFile` for writing without specifying the *mode*
      argument is deprecated.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.12
      Remove the ``filename`` attribute, use the :attr:`~GzipFile.name`
      attribute instead.


.. function:: compress(data, compresslevel=9, *, mtime=0)

   Compress the *data*, returning a :class:`bytes` object containing
   the compressed data.  *compresslevel* and *mtime* have the same meaning as in
   the :class:`GzipFile` constructor above,
   but *mtime* defaults to 0 for reproducible output.

   .. versionadded:: 3.2
   .. versionchanged:: 3.8
      Added the *mtime* parameter for reproducible output.
   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      Speed is improved by compressing all data at once instead of in a
      streamed fashion. Calls with *mtime* set to ``0`` are delegated to
      :func:`zlib.compress` for better speed. In this situation the
      output may contain a gzip header "OS" byte value other than 255
      "unknown" as supplied by the underlying zlib implementation.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.13
      The gzip header OS byte is guaranteed to be set to 255 when this function
      is used as was the case in 3.10 and earlier.
   .. versionchanged:: 3.14
      The *mtime* parameter now defaults to 0 for reproducible output.
      For the previous behaviour of using the current time,
      pass ``None`` to *mtime*.

.. function:: decompress(data)

   Decompress the *data*, returning a :class:`bytes` object containing the
   uncompressed data. This function is capable of decompressing multi-member
   gzip data (multiple gzip blocks concatenated together). When the data is
   certain to contain only one member the :func:`zlib.decompress` function with
   *wbits* set to 31 is faster.

   .. versionadded:: 3.2
   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      Speed is improved by decompressing members at once in memory instead of in
      a streamed fashion.

--------------

This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and
message digest algorithms.  Included are the FIPS secure hash algorithms SHA1,
SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, (defined in `the FIPS 180-4 standard`_),
the SHA-3 series (defined in `the FIPS 202 standard`_) as well as RSA's MD5
algorithm (defined in internet :rfc:`1321`).  The terms "secure hash" and
"message digest" are interchangeable.  Older algorithms were called message
digests.  The modern term is secure hash.

.. note::

   If you want the adler32 or crc32 hash functions, they are available in
   the :mod:`zlib` module.


.. _hash-algorithms:

Hash algorithms
---------------

There is one constructor method named for each type of :dfn:`hash`.  All return
a hash object with the same simple interface. For example: use :func:`sha256`
to create a SHA-256 hash object. You can now feed this object with
:term:`bytes-like objects <bytes-like object>` (normally :class:`bytes`) using
the :meth:`update<hash.update>` method.  At any point you can ask it for the
:dfn:`digest` of the concatenation of the data fed to it so far using the
:meth:`digest()<hash.digest>` or :meth:`hexdigest()<hash.hexdigest>` methods.

To allow multithreading, the Python :term:`GIL` is released while computing a
hash supplied more than 2047 bytes of data at once in its constructor or
:meth:`.update<hash.update>` method.


.. index:: single: OpenSSL; (use in module hashlib)

Constructors for hash algorithms that are always present in this module are
:func:`sha1`, :func:`sha224`, :func:`sha256`, :func:`sha384`, :func:`sha512`,
:func:`sha3_224`, :func:`sha3_256`, :func:`sha3_384`, :func:`sha3_512`,
:func:`shake_128`, :func:`shake_256`, :func:`blake2b`, and :func:`blake2s`.
:func:`md5` is normally available as well, though it may be missing or blocked
if you are using a rare "FIPS compliant" build of Python.
These correspond to :data:`algorithms_guaranteed`.

Additional algorithms may also be available if your Python distribution's
:mod:`hashlib` was linked against a build of OpenSSL that provides others.
Others *are not guaranteed available* on all installations and will only be
accessible by name via :func:`new`.  See :data:`algorithms_available`.

.. warning::

   Some algorithms have known hash collision weaknesses (including MD5 and

   SHA3 (Keccak) and SHAKE constructors :func:`sha3_224`, :func:`sha3_256`,
   :func:`sha3_384`, :func:`sha3_512`, :func:`shake_128`, :func:`shake_256`
   were added.
   :func:`blake2b` and :func:`blake2s` were added.

.. _hashlib-usedforsecurity:

.. versionchanged:: 3.9
   All hashlib constructors take a keyword-only argument *usedforsecurity*
   with default value ``True``. A false value allows the use of insecure and
   blocked hashing algorithms in restricted environments. ``False`` indicates
   that the hashing algorithm is not used in a security context, e.g. as a
   non-cryptographic one-way compression function.

.. versionchanged:: 3.9
   Hashlib now uses SHA3 and SHAKE from OpenSSL if it provides it.

.. versionchanged:: 3.12
   For any of the MD5, SHA1, SHA2, or SHA3 algorithms that the linked
   OpenSSL does not provide we fall back to a verified implementation from
   the `HACL\* project`_.

Usage
-----

To obtain the digest of the byte string ``b"Nobody inspects the spammish
repetition"``::

   >>> import hashlib
   >>> m = hashlib.sha256()
   >>> m.update(b"Nobody inspects")
   >>> m.update(b" the spammish repetition")
   >>> m.digest()
   b'\x03\x1e\xdd}Ae\x15\x93\xc5\xfe\\\x00o\xa5u+7\xfd\xdf\xf7\xbcN\x84:\xa6\xaf\x0c\x95\x0fK\x94\x06'
   >>> m.hexdigest()
   '031edd7d41651593c5fe5c006fa5752b37fddff7bc4e843aa6af0c950f4b9406'

More condensed:

   >>> hashlib.sha256(b"Nobody inspects the spammish repetition").hexdigest()
   '031edd7d41651593c5fe5c006fa5752b37fddff7bc4e843aa6af0c950f4b9406'

Constructors
------------

.. function:: new(name[, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)

   Is a generic constructor that takes the string *name* of the desired
   algorithm as its first parameter.  It also exists to allow access to the
   above listed hashes as well as any other algorithms that your OpenSSL
   library may offer.

Using :func:`new` with an algorithm name:

   >>> h = hashlib.new('sha256')
   >>> h.update(b"Nobody inspects the spammish repetition")
   >>> h.hexdigest()
   '031edd7d41651593c5fe5c006fa5752b37fddff7bc4e843aa6af0c950f4b9406'


.. function:: md5([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha1([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha224([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha256([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha384([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha512([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha3_224([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha3_256([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha3_384([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: sha3_512([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)

Named constructors such as these are faster than passing an algorithm name to
:func:`new`.

Attributes
----------

Hashlib provides the following constant module attributes:

.. data:: algorithms_guaranteed

   A set containing the names of the hash algorithms guaranteed to be supported
   by this module on all platforms.  Note that 'md5' is in this list despite
   some upstream vendors offering an odd "FIPS compliant" Python build that
   excludes it.

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

.. data:: algorithms_available

   A set containing the names of the hash algorithms that are available in the
   running Python interpreter.  These names will be recognized when passed to
   :func:`new`.  :attr:`algorithms_guaranteed` will always be a subset.  The
   same algorithm may appear multiple times in this set under different names
   (thanks to OpenSSL).

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

Hash Objects
------------

The following values are provided as constant attributes of the hash objects
returned by the constructors:

.. data:: hash.digest_size

   The size of the resulting hash in bytes.

.. data:: hash.block_size

   The internal block size of the hash algorithm in bytes.

A hash object has the following attributes:

.. attribute:: hash.name

   The canonical name of this hash, always lowercase and always suitable as a
   parameter to :func:`new` to create another hash of this type.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      The name attribute has been present in CPython since its inception, but
      until Python 3.4 was not formally specified, so may not exist on some
      platforms.

A hash object has the following methods:


.. method:: hash.update(data)

   Update the hash object with the :term:`bytes-like object`.
   Repeated calls are equivalent to a single call with the
   concatenation of all the arguments: ``m.update(a); m.update(b)`` is
   equivalent to ``m.update(a+b)``.


.. method:: hash.digest()

   Return the digest of the data passed to the :meth:`update` method so far.
   This is a bytes object of size :attr:`digest_size` which may contain bytes in
   the whole range from 0 to 255.


.. method:: hash.hexdigest()

   Like :meth:`digest` except the digest is returned as a string object of
   double length, containing only hexadecimal digits.  This may be used to
   exchange the value safely in email or other non-binary environments.


.. method:: hash.copy()

   Return a copy ("clone") of the hash object.  This can be used to efficiently
   compute the digests of data sharing a common initial substring.


SHAKE variable length digests
-----------------------------

.. function:: shake_128([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)
.. function:: shake_256([, data], *, usedforsecurity=True)

The :func:`shake_128` and :func:`shake_256` algorithms provide variable
length digests with length_in_bits//2 up to 128 or 256 bits of security.
As such, their digest methods require a length. Maximum length is not limited
by the SHAKE algorithm.

.. method:: shake.digest(length)

   Return the digest of the data passed to the :meth:`~hash.update` method so far.
   This is a bytes object of size *length* which may contain bytes in
   the whole range from 0 to 255.


.. method:: shake.hexdigest(length)

   Like :meth:`digest` except the digest is returned as a string object of
   double length, containing only hexadecimal digits.  This may be used to
   exchange the value in email or other non-binary environments.

Example use:

   >>> h = hashlib.shake_256(b'Nobody inspects the spammish repetition')
   >>> h.hexdigest(20)
   '44709d6fcb83d92a76dcb0b668c98e1b1d3dafe7'

File hashing
------------

The hashlib module provides a helper function for efficient hashing of
a file or file-like object.

.. function:: file_digest(fileobj, digest, /)

   Return a digest object that has been updated with contents of file object.

   *fileobj* must be a file-like object opened for reading in binary mode.
   It accepts file objects from  builtin :func:`open`, :class:`~io.BytesIO`
   instances, SocketIO objects from :meth:`socket.socket.makefile`, and
   similar. The function may bypass Python's I/O and use the file descriptor
   from :meth:`~io.IOBase.fileno` directly. *fileobj* must be assumed to be
   in an unknown state after this function returns or raises. It is up to
   the caller to close *fileobj*.

   *digest* must either be a hash algorithm name as a *str*, a hash
   constructor, or a callable that returns a hash object.

   Example:

      >>> import io, hashlib, hmac
      >>> with open(hashlib.__file__, "rb") as f:
      ...     digest = hashlib.file_digest(f, "sha256")
      ...
      >>> digest.hexdigest()  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
      '...'

      >>> buf = io.BytesIO(b"somedata")
      >>> mac1 = hmac.HMAC(b"key", digestmod=hashlib.sha512)
      >>> digest = hashlib.file_digest(buf, lambda: mac1)

      >>> digest is mac1
      True
      >>> mac2 = hmac.HMAC(b"key", b"somedata", digestmod=hashlib.sha512)
      >>> mac1.digest() == mac2.digest()
      True

   .. versionadded:: 3.11


Key derivation
--------------

Key derivation and key stretching algorithms are designed for secure password
hashing. Naive algorithms such as ``sha1(password)`` are not resistant against
brute-force attacks. A good password hashing function must be tunable, slow, and
include a `salt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29>`_.


.. function:: pbkdf2_hmac(hash_name, password, salt, iterations, dklen=None)

   The function provides PKCS#5 password-based key derivation function 2. It
   uses HMAC as pseudorandom function.

   The string *hash_name* is the desired name of the hash digest algorithm for
   HMAC, e.g. 'sha1' or 'sha256'. *password* and *salt* are interpreted as
   buffers of bytes. Applications and libraries should limit *password* to
   a sensible length (e.g. 1024). *salt* should be about 16 or more bytes from
   a proper source, e.g. :func:`os.urandom`.

   The number of *iterations* should be chosen based on the hash algorithm and
   computing power. As of 2022, hundreds of thousands of iterations of SHA-256
   are suggested. For rationale as to why and how to choose what is best for
   your application, read *Appendix A.2.2* of NIST-SP-800-132_. The answers
   on the `stackexchange pbkdf2 iterations question`_ explain in detail.

   *dklen* is the length of the derived key in bytes. If *dklen* is ``None`` then the
   digest size of the hash algorithm *hash_name* is used, e.g. 64 for SHA-512.

   >>> from hashlib import pbkdf2_hmac
   >>> our_app_iters = 500_000  # Application specific, read above.
   >>> dk = pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', b'password', b'bad salt' * 2, our_app_iters)
   >>> dk.hex()
   '15530bba69924174860db778f2c6f8104d3aaf9d26241840c8c4a641c8d000a9'

   Function only available when Python is compiled with OpenSSL.

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

   .. versionchanged:: 3.12
      Function now only available when Python is built with OpenSSL. The slow
      pure Python implementation has been removed.

.. function:: scrypt(password, *, salt, n, r, p, maxmem=0, dklen=64)

   The function provides scrypt password-based key derivation function as
   defined in :rfc:`7914`.

   *password* and *salt* must be :term:`bytes-like objects
   <bytes-like object>`.  Applications and libraries should limit *password*
   to a sensible length (e.g. 1024).  *salt* should be about 16 or more
   bytes from a proper source, e.g. :func:`os.urandom`.

   *n* is the CPU/Memory cost factor, *r* the block size, *p* parallelization
   factor and *maxmem* limits memory (OpenSSL 1.1.0 defaults to 32 MiB).
   *dklen* is the length of the derived key in bytes.

   .. versionadded:: 3.6


.. _hashlib-blake2:

BLAKE2
------

.. sectionauthor:: Dmitry Chestnykh

.. index::
   single: blake2b, blake2s

BLAKE2_ is a cryptographic hash function defined in :rfc:`7693` that comes in two
flavors:

* **BLAKE2b**, optimized for 64-bit platforms and produces digests of any size
  between 1 and 64 bytes,

* **BLAKE2s**, optimized for 8- to 32-bit platforms and produces digests of any
  size between 1 and 32 bytes.

BLAKE2 supports **keyed mode** (a faster and simpler replacement for HMAC_),
**salted hashing**, **personalization**, and **tree hashing**.

Hash objects from this module follow the API of standard library's
:mod:`hashlib` objects.


Creating hash objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New hash objects are created by calling constructor functions:


.. function:: blake2b(data=b'', *, digest_size=64, key=b'', salt=b'', \
                person=b'', fanout=1, depth=1, leaf_size=0, node_offset=0,  \
                node_depth=0, inner_size=0, last_node=False, \
                usedforsecurity=True)

.. function:: blake2s(data=b'', *, digest_size=32, key=b'', salt=b'', \
                person=b'', fanout=1, depth=1, leaf_size=0, node_offset=0,  \
                node_depth=0, inner_size=0, last_node=False, \
                usedforsecurity=True)


These functions return the corresponding hash objects for calculating
BLAKE2b or BLAKE2s. They optionally take these general parameters:

* *data*: initial chunk of data to hash, which must be
  :term:`bytes-like object`.  It can be passed only as positional argument.

* *digest_size*: size of output digest in bytes.

* *key*: key for keyed hashing (up to 64 bytes for BLAKE2b, up to 32 bytes for
  BLAKE2s).

* *salt*: salt for randomized hashing (up to 16 bytes for BLAKE2b, up to 8
  bytes for BLAKE2s).

* *person*: personalization string (up to 16 bytes for BLAKE2b, up to 8 bytes
  for BLAKE2s).

The following table shows limits for general parameters (in bytes):

======= =========== ======== ========= ===========
Hash    digest_size len(key) len(salt) len(person)
======= =========== ======== ========= ===========
BLAKE2b     64         64       16        16
BLAKE2s     32         32       8         8
======= =========== ======== ========= ===========

.. note::

    BLAKE2 specification defines constant lengths for salt and personalization
    parameters, however, for convenience, this implementation accepts byte
    strings of any size up to the specified length. If the length of the
    parameter is less than specified, it is padded with zeros, thus, for
    example, ``b'salt'`` and ``b'salt\x00'`` is the same value. (This is not
    the case for *key*.)

These sizes are available as module `constants`_ described below.

Constructor functions also accept the following tree hashing parameters:

* *fanout*: fanout (0 to 255, 0 if unlimited, 1 in sequential mode).

* *depth*: maximal depth of tree (1 to 255, 255 if unlimited, 1 in
  sequential mode).

* *leaf_size*: maximal byte length of leaf (0 to ``2**32-1``, 0 if unlimited or in
  sequential mode).

* *node_offset*: node offset (0 to ``2**64-1`` for BLAKE2b, 0 to ``2**48-1`` for
  BLAKE2s, 0 for the first, leftmost, leaf, or in sequential mode).

* *node_depth*: node depth (0 to 255, 0 for leaves, or in sequential mode).

* *inner_size*: inner digest size (0 to 64 for BLAKE2b, 0 to 32 for
  BLAKE2s, 0 in sequential mode).

* *last_node*: boolean indicating whether the processed node is the last
  one (``False`` for sequential mode).

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Simple hashing
""""""""""""""

To calculate hash of some data, you should first construct a hash object by
calling the appropriate constructor function (:func:`blake2b` or
:func:`blake2s`), then update it with the data by calling :meth:`~hash.update` on the
object, and, finally, get the digest out of the object by calling
:meth:`~hash.digest` (or :meth:`~hash.hexdigest` for hex-encoded string).

    >>> from hashlib import blake2b
    >>> h = blake2b()
    >>> h.update(b'Hello world')
    >>> h.hexdigest()
    '6ff843ba685842aa82031d3f53c48b66326df7639a63d128974c5c14f31a0f33343a8c65551134ed1ae0f2b0dd2bb495dc81039e3eeb0aa1bb0388bbeac29183'


As a shortcut, you can pass the first chunk of data to update directly to the
constructor as the positional argument:

    >>> from hashlib import blake2b
    >>> blake2b(b'Hello world').hexdigest()
    '6ff843ba685842aa82031d3f53c48b66326df7639a63d128974c5c14f31a0f33343a8c65551134ed1ae0f2b0dd2bb495dc81039e3eeb0aa1bb0388bbeac29183'

You can call :meth:`hash.update` as many times as you need to iteratively
update the hash:

    >>> from hashlib import blake2b
    >>> items = [b'Hello', b' ', b'world']
    >>> h = blake2b()
    >>> for item in items:
    ...     h.update(item)
    ...
    >>> h.hexdigest()
    '6ff843ba685842aa82031d3f53c48b66326df7639a63d128974c5c14f31a0f33343a8c65551134ed1ae0f2b0dd2bb495dc81039e3eeb0aa1bb0388bbeac29183'


Using different digest sizes
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

BLAKE2 has configurable size of digests up to 64 bytes for BLAKE2b and up to 32
bytes for BLAKE2s. For example, to replace SHA-1 with BLAKE2b without changing
the size of output, we can tell BLAKE2b to produce 20-byte digests:

    >>> from hashlib import blake2b
    >>> h = blake2b(digest_size=20)
    >>> h.update(b'Replacing SHA1 with the more secure function')
    >>> h.hexdigest()
    'd24f26cf8de66472d58d4e1b1774b4c9158b1f4c'
    >>> h.digest_size
    20
    >>> len(h.digest())
    20

Hash objects with different digest sizes have completely different outputs
(shorter hashes are *not* prefixes of longer hashes); BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s
produce different outputs even if the output length is the same:

    >>> from hashlib import blake2b, blake2s
    >>> blake2b(digest_size=10).hexdigest()
    '6fa1d8fcfd719046d762'
    >>> blake2b(digest_size=11).hexdigest()
    'eb6ec15daf9546254f0809'
    >>> blake2s(digest_size=10).hexdigest()
    '1bf21a98c78a1c376ae9'
    >>> blake2s(digest_size=11).hexdigest()
    '567004bf96e4a25773ebf4'


Keyed hashing
"""""""""""""

Keyed hashing can be used for authentication as a faster and simpler
replacement for `Hash-based message authentication code
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC>`_ (HMAC).
BLAKE2 can be securely used in prefix-MAC mode thanks to the
indifferentiability property inherited from BLAKE.

This example shows how to get a (hex-encoded) 128-bit authentication code for
message ``b'message data'`` with key ``b'pseudorandom key'``::

    >>> from hashlib import blake2b
    >>> h = blake2b(key=b'pseudorandom key', digest_size=16)
    >>> h.update(b'message data')
    >>> h.hexdigest()
    '3d363ff7401e02026f4a4687d4863ced'


As a practical example, a web application can symmetrically sign cookies sent
to users and later verify them to make sure they weren't tampered with::

    >>> from hashlib import blake2b
    >>> from hmac import compare_digest
    >>>
    >>> SECRET_KEY = b'pseudorandomly generated server secret key'
    >>> AUTH_SIZE = 16
    >>>
    >>> def sign(cookie):
    ...     h = blake2b(digest_size=AUTH_SIZE, key=SECRET_KEY)
    ...     h.update(cookie)
    ...     return h.hexdigest().encode('utf-8')
    >>>
    >>> def verify(cookie, sig):
    ...     good_sig = sign(cookie)
    ...     return compare_digest(good_sig, sig)
    >>>
    >>> cookie = b'user-alice'
    >>> sig = sign(cookie)
    >>> print("{0},{1}".format(cookie.decode('utf-8'), sig))
    user-alice,b'43b3c982cf697e0c5ab22172d1ca7421'
    >>> verify(cookie, sig)
    True
    >>> verify(b'user-bob', sig)
    False
    >>> verify(cookie, b'0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f00')
    False

Even though there's a native keyed hashing mode, BLAKE2 can, of course, be used
in HMAC construction with :mod:`hmac` module::

    >>> import hmac, hashlib
    >>> m = hmac.new(b'secret key', digestmod=hashlib.blake2s)
    >>> m.update(b'message')
    >>> m.hexdigest()
    'e3c8102868d28b5ff85fc35dda07329970d1a01e273c37481326fe0c861c8142'


Randomized hashing
""""""""""""""""""

By setting *salt* parameter users can introduce randomization to the hash
function. Randomized hashing is useful for protecting against collision attacks
on the hash function used in digital signatures.

    Randomized hashing is designed for situations where one party, the message
    preparer, generates all or part of a message to be signed by a second
    party, the message signer. If the message preparer is able to find
    cryptographic hash function collisions (i.e., two messages producing the
    same hash value), then they might prepare meaningful versions of the message
    that would produce the same hash value and digital signature, but with
    different results (e.g., transferring $1,000,000 to an account, rather than
    $10). Cryptographic hash functions have been designed with collision
    resistance as a major goal, but the current concentration on attacking
    cryptographic hash functions may result in a given cryptographic hash
    function providing less collision resistance than expected. Randomized
    hashing offers the signer additional protection by reducing the likelihood
    that a preparer can generate two or more messages that ultimately yield the
    same hash value during the digital signature generation process --- even if
    it is practical to find collisions for the hash function. However, the use
    of randomized hashing may reduce the amount of security provided by a
    digital signature when all portions of the message are prepared
    by the signer.

    (`NIST SP-800-106 "Randomized Hashing for Digital Signatures"
    <https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/106/final>`_)

In BLAKE2 the salt is processed as a one-time input to the hash function during
initialization, rather than as an input to each compression function.

.. warning::

    *Salted hashing* (or just hashing) with BLAKE2 or any other general-purpose
    cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256, is not suitable for hashing
    passwords.  See `BLAKE2 FAQ <https://www.blake2.net/#qa>`_ for more
    information.
..

    >>> h2.update(msg)
    >>> # The digests are different.
    >>> h1.digest() != h2.digest()
    True


Personalization
"""""""""""""""

Sometimes it is useful to force hash function to produce different digests for
the same input for different purposes. Quoting the authors of the Skein hash
function:

    We recommend that all application designers seriously consider doing this;
    we have seen many protocols where a hash that is computed in one part of
    the protocol can be used in an entirely different part because two hash
    computations were done on similar or related data, and the attacker can
    force the application to make the hash inputs the same. Personalizing each

BLAKE2 can be personalized by passing bytes to the *person* argument::

    >>> from hashlib import blake2b
    >>> FILES_HASH_PERSON = b'MyApp Files Hash'
    >>> BLOCK_HASH_PERSON = b'MyApp Block Hash'
    >>> h = blake2b(digest_size=32, person=FILES_HASH_PERSON)
    >>> h.update(b'the same content')
    >>> h.hexdigest()
    '20d9cd024d4fb086aae819a1432dd2466de12947831b75c5a30cf2676095d3b4'
    >>> h = blake2b(digest_size=32, person=BLOCK_HASH_PERSON)
    >>> h.update(b'the same content')

Personalization together with the keyed mode can also be used to derive different
keys from a single one.

    >>> from hashlib import blake2s

    >>> orig_key = b64decode(b'Rm5EPJai72qcK3RGBpW3vPNfZy5OZothY+kHY6h21KM=')
    >>> enc_key = blake2s(key=orig_key, person=b'kEncrypt').digest()
    >>> mac_key = blake2s(key=orig_key, person=b'kMAC').digest()
    >>> print(b64encode(enc_key).decode('utf-8'))

:mod:`!heapq` --- Heap queue algorithm
======================================

.. module:: heapq
   :synopsis: Heap queue algorithm (a.k.a. priority queue).

.. moduleauthor:: Kevin O'Connor
.. sectionauthor:: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/heapq.py`

--------------

This module provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known
as the priority queue algorithm.

Heaps are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or
equal to any of its children.  We refer to this condition as the heap invariant.

This implementation uses arrays for which
``heap[k] <= heap[2*k+1]`` and ``heap[k] <= heap[2*k+2]`` for all *k*, counting
elements from zero.  For the sake of comparison, non-existing elements are
considered to be infinite.  The interesting property of a heap is that its
smallest element is always the root, ``heap[0]``.

The API below differs from textbook heap algorithms in two aspects: (a) We use
zero-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the index for a node
and the indexes for its children slightly less obvious, but is more suitable
since Python uses zero-based indexing. (b) Our pop method returns the smallest
item, not the largest (called a "min heap" in textbooks; a "max heap" is more
common in texts because of its suitability for in-place sorting).

These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list without
surprises: ``heap[0]`` is the smallest item, and ``heap.sort()`` maintains the
heap invariant!

To create a heap, use a list initialized to ``[]``, or you can transform a
populated list into a heap via function :func:`heapify`.

The following functions are provided:


.. function:: heappush(heap, item)

   Push the value *item* onto the *heap*, maintaining the heap invariant.


.. function:: heappop(heap)

   Pop and return the smallest item from the *heap*, maintaining the heap
   invariant.  If the heap is empty, :exc:`IndexError` is raised.  To access the
   smallest item without popping it, use ``heap[0]``.


.. function:: heappushpop(heap, item)

   Push *item* on the heap, then pop and return the smallest item from the
   *heap*.  The combined action runs more efficiently than :func:`heappush`
   followed by a separate call to :func:`heappop`.


.. function:: heapify(x)

   Transform list *x* into a heap, in-place, in linear time.


.. function:: heapreplace(heap, item)

   Pop and return the smallest item from the *heap*, and also push the new *item*.
   The heap size doesn't change. If the heap is empty, :exc:`IndexError` is raised.

   This one step operation is more efficient than a :func:`heappop` followed by
   :func:`heappush` and can be more appropriate when using a fixed-size heap.
   The pop/push combination always returns an element from the heap and replaces
   it with *item*.

   The value returned may be larger than the *item* added.  If that isn't
   desired, consider using :func:`heappushpop` instead.  Its push/pop
   combination returns the smaller of the two values, leaving the larger value
   on the heap.


The module also offers three general purpose functions based on heaps.


.. function:: merge(*iterables, key=None, reverse=False)

   Merge multiple sorted inputs into a single sorted output (for example, merge
   timestamped entries from multiple log files).  Returns an :term:`iterator`
   over the sorted values.

   Similar to ``sorted(itertools.chain(*iterables))`` but returns an iterable, does
   not pull the data into memory all at once, and assumes that each of the input
   streams is already sorted (smallest to largest).

   Has two optional arguments which must be specified as keyword arguments.

   *key* specifies a :term:`key function` of one argument that is used to
   extract a comparison key from each input element.  The default value is
   ``None`` (compare the elements directly).

   *reverse* is a boolean value.  If set to ``True``, then the input elements
   are merged as if each comparison were reversed. To achieve behavior similar
   to ``sorted(itertools.chain(*iterables), reverse=True)``, all iterables must
   be sorted from largest to smallest.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Added the optional *key* and *reverse* parameters.


.. function:: nlargest(n, iterable, key=None)

   Return a list with the *n* largest elements from the dataset defined by
   *iterable*.  *key*, if provided, specifies a function of one argument that is
   used to extract a comparison key from each element in *iterable* (for example,
   ``key=str.lower``).  Equivalent to:  ``sorted(iterable, key=key,
   reverse=True)[:n]``.


.. function:: nsmallest(n, iterable, key=None)

   Return a list with the *n* smallest elements from the dataset defined by
   *iterable*.  *key*, if provided, specifies a function of one argument that is
   used to extract a comparison key from each element in *iterable* (for example,
   ``key=str.lower``).  Equivalent to:  ``sorted(iterable, key=key)[:n]``.


The latter two functions perform best for smaller values of *n*.  For larger
values, it is more efficient to use the :func:`sorted` function.  Also, when
``n==1``, it is more efficient to use the built-in :func:`min` and :func:`max`
functions.  If repeated usage of these functions is required, consider turning
the iterable into an actual heap.


Basic Examples
--------------

A `heapsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort>`_ can be implemented by
pushing all values onto a heap and then popping off the smallest values one at a
time::

   >>> def heapsort(iterable):
   ...     h = []
   ...     for value in iterable:
   ...         heappush(h, value)
   ...     return [heappop(h) for i in range(len(h))]
   ...
   >>> heapsort([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0])
   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

This is similar to ``sorted(iterable)``, but unlike :func:`sorted`, this
implementation is not stable.

Heap elements can be tuples.  This is useful for assigning comparison values
(such as task priorities) alongside the main record being tracked::

    >>> h = []
    >>> heappush(h, (5, 'write code'))
    >>> heappush(h, (7, 'release product'))
    >>> heappush(h, (1, 'write spec'))
    >>> heappush(h, (3, 'create tests'))
    >>> heappop(h)
    (1, 'write spec')


Priority Queue Implementation Notes
-----------------------------------

A `priority queue <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue>`_ is common use
for a heap, and it presents several implementation challenges:

* Sort stability:  how do you get two tasks with equal priorities to be returned
  in the order they were originally added?

* Tuple comparison breaks for (priority, task) pairs if the priorities are equal
  and the tasks do not have a default comparison order.

* If the priority of a task changes, how do you move it to a new position in
  the heap?

* Or if a pending task needs to be deleted, how do you find it and remove it
  from the queue?

A solution to the first two challenges is to store entries as 3-element list
including the priority, an entry count, and the task.  The entry count serves as
a tie-breaker so that two tasks with the same priority are returned in the order
they were added. And since no two entry counts are the same, the tuple
comparison will never attempt to directly compare two tasks.

Another solution to the problem of non-comparable tasks is to create a wrapper
class that ignores the task item and only compares the priority field::

    from dataclasses import dataclass, field
    from typing import Any

    @dataclass(order=True)
    class PrioritizedItem:
        priority: int
        item: Any=field(compare=False)

The remaining challenges revolve around finding a pending task and making
changes to its priority or removing it entirely.  Finding a task can be done
with a dictionary pointing to an entry in the queue.

Removing the entry or changing its priority is more difficult because it would
break the heap structure invariants.  So, a possible solution is to mark the
entry as removed and add a new entry with the revised priority::

    pq = []                         # list of entries arranged in a heap
    entry_finder = {}               # mapping of tasks to entries
    REMOVED = '<removed-task>'      # placeholder for a removed task
    counter = itertools.count()     # unique sequence count

    def add_task(task, priority=0):
        'Add a new task or update the priority of an existing task'
        if task in entry_finder:
            remove_task(task)
        count = next(counter)
        entry = [priority, count, task]
        entry_finder[task] = entry
        heappush(pq, entry)

    def remove_task(task):
        'Mark an existing task as REMOVED.  Raise KeyError if not found.'
        entry = entry_finder.pop(task)
        entry[-1] = REMOVED

    def pop_task():
        'Remove and return the lowest priority task. Raise KeyError if empty.'
        while pq:
            priority, count, task = heappop(pq)
            if task is not REMOVED:
                del entry_finder[task]
                return task
        raise KeyError('pop from an empty priority queue')


Theory
------

Heaps are arrays for which ``a[k] <= a[2*k+1]`` and ``a[k] <= a[2*k+2]`` for all
*k*, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison, non-existing
elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting property of a heap is
that ``a[0]`` is always its smallest element.

The strange invariant above is meant to be an efficient memory representation
for a tournament.  The numbers below are *k*, not ``a[k]``::

                                  0

                 1                                 2

         3               4                5               6

     7       8       9       10      11      12      13      14

   15 16   17 18   19 20   21 22   23 24   25 26   27 28   29 30

In the tree above, each cell *k* is topping ``2*k+1`` and ``2*k+2``. In a usual
binary tournament we see in sports, each cell is the winner over the two cells
it tops, and we can trace the winner down the tree to see all opponents s/he
had.  However, in many computer applications of such tournaments, we do not need
to trace the history of a winner. To be more memory efficient, when a winner is
promoted, we try to replace it by something else at a lower level, and the rule
becomes that a cell and the two cells it tops contain three different items, but
the top cell "wins" over the two topped cells.

If this heap invariant is protected at all time, index 0 is clearly the overall
winner.  The simplest algorithmic way to remove it and find the "next" winner is
to move some loser (let's say cell 30 in the diagram above) into the 0 position,
and then percolate this new 0 down the tree, exchanging values, until the
invariant is re-established. This is clearly logarithmic on the total number of
items in the tree. By iterating over all items, you get an *O*\ (*n* log *n*) sort.

A nice feature of this sort is that you can efficiently insert new items while
the sort is going on, provided that the inserted items are not "better" than the
last 0'th element you extracted.  This is especially useful in simulation
contexts, where the tree holds all incoming events, and the "win" condition
means the smallest scheduled time.  When an event schedules other events for
execution, they are scheduled into the future, so they can easily go into the
heap.  So, a heap is a good structure for implementing schedulers (this is what
I used for my MIDI sequencer :-).

Various structures for implementing schedulers have been extensively studied,
and heaps are good for this, as they are reasonably speedy, the speed is almost
constant, and the worst case is not much different than the average case.
However, there are other representations which are more efficient overall, yet
the worst cases might be terrible.

Heaps are also very useful in big disk sorts.  You most probably all know that a
big sort implies producing "runs" (which are pre-sorted sequences, whose size is
usually related to the amount of CPU memory), followed by a merging passes for
these runs, which merging is often very cleverly organised [#]_. It is very
important that the initial sort produces the longest runs possible.  Tournaments
are a good way to achieve that.  If, using all the memory available to hold a
tournament, you replace and percolate items that happen to fit the current run,
you'll produce runs which are twice the size of the memory for random input, and
much better for input fuzzily ordered.

Moreover, if you output the 0'th item on disk and get an input which may not fit
in the current tournament (because the value "wins" over the last output value),
it cannot fit in the heap, so the size of the heap decreases.  The freed memory
could be cleverly reused immediately for progressively building a second heap,
which grows at exactly the same rate the first heap is melting.  When the first
heap completely vanishes, you switch heaps and start a new run.  Clever and
quite effective!

In a word, heaps are useful memory structures to know.  I use them in a few
applications, and I think it is good to keep a 'heap' module around. :-)

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] The disk balancing algorithms which are current, nowadays, are more annoying
   than clever, and this is a consequence of the seeking capabilities of the disks.
   On devices which cannot seek, like big tape drives, the story was quite
   different, and one had to be very clever to ensure (far in advance) that each
   tape movement will be the most effective possible (that is, will best
   participate at "progressing" the merge).  Some tapes were even able to read
   backwards, and this was also used to avoid the rewinding time. Believe me, real
   good tape sorts were quite spectacular to watch! From all times, sorting has
   always been a Great Art! :-)

.. module:: hmac
   :synopsis: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication (HMAC) implementation

.. moduleauthor:: Gerhard Häring <ghaering@users.sourceforge.net>
.. sectionauthor:: Gerhard Häring <ghaering@users.sourceforge.net>

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/hmac.py`

--------------

This module implements the HMAC algorithm as described by :rfc:`2104`.


.. function:: new(key, msg=None, digestmod)

   Return a new hmac object.  *key* is a bytes or bytearray object giving the
   secret key.  If *msg* is present, the method call ``update(msg)`` is made.
   *digestmod* is the digest name, digest constructor or module for the HMAC
   object to use.  It may be any name suitable to :func:`hashlib.new`.
   Despite its argument position, it is required.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      Parameter *key* can be a bytes or bytearray object.
      Parameter *msg* can be of any type supported by :mod:`hashlib`.
      Parameter *digestmod* can be the name of a hash algorithm.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.8
      The *digestmod* argument is now required.  Pass it as a keyword
      argument to avoid awkwardness when you do not have an initial *msg*.


.. function:: digest(key, msg, digest)

   Return digest of *msg* for given secret *key* and *digest*. The
   function is equivalent to ``HMAC(key, msg, digest).digest()``, but
   uses an optimized C or inline implementation, which is faster for messages
   that fit into memory. The parameters *key*, *msg*, and *digest* have
   the same meaning as in :func:`~hmac.new`.

   CPython implementation detail, the optimized C implementation is only used
   when *digest* is a string and name of a digest algorithm, which is
   supported by OpenSSL.

   .. versionadded:: 3.7


An HMAC object has the following methods:

.. method:: HMAC.update(msg)

   Update the hmac object with *msg*.  Repeated calls are equivalent to a
   single call with the concatenation of all the arguments:
   ``m.update(a); m.update(b)`` is equivalent to ``m.update(a + b)``.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      Parameter *msg* can be of any type supported by :mod:`hashlib`.


.. method:: HMAC.digest()

   Return the digest of the bytes passed to the :meth:`update` method so far.
   This bytes object will be the same length as the *digest_size* of the digest
   given to the constructor.  It may contain non-ASCII bytes, including NUL
   bytes.

   .. warning::

      When comparing the output of :meth:`digest` to an externally supplied
      digest during a verification routine, it is recommended to use the
      :func:`compare_digest` function instead of the ``==`` operator
      to reduce the vulnerability to timing attacks.


.. method:: HMAC.hexdigest()

   Like :meth:`digest` except the digest is returned as a string twice the
   length containing only hexadecimal digits.  This may be used to exchange the
   value safely in email or other non-binary environments.

   .. warning::

      When comparing the output of :meth:`hexdigest` to an externally supplied
      digest during a verification routine, it is recommended to use the
      :func:`compare_digest` function instead of the ``==`` operator
      to reduce the vulnerability to timing attacks.


.. method:: HMAC.copy()

   Return a copy ("clone") of the hmac object.  This can be used to efficiently
   compute the digests of strings that share a common initial substring.


A hash object has the following attributes:

.. attribute:: HMAC.digest_size

   The size of the resulting HMAC digest in bytes.

.. attribute:: HMAC.block_size

   The internal block size of the hash algorithm in bytes.

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

.. attribute:: HMAC.name

   The canonical name of this HMAC, always lowercase, e.g. ``hmac-md5``.

   .. versionadded:: 3.4


.. versionchanged:: 3.10
   Removed the undocumented attributes ``HMAC.digest_cons``, ``HMAC.inner``,
   and ``HMAC.outer``.

This module also provides the following helper function:

.. function:: compare_digest(a, b)

   Return ``a == b``.  This function uses an approach designed to prevent
   timing analysis by avoiding content-based short circuiting behaviour,
   making it appropriate for cryptography.  *a* and *b* must both be of the
   same type: either :class:`str` (ASCII only, as e.g. returned by
   :meth:`HMAC.hexdigest`), or a :term:`bytes-like object`.

   .. note::

      If *a* and *b* are of different lengths, or if an error occurs,
      a timing attack could theoretically reveal information about the
      types and lengths of *a* and *b*—but not their values.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10

      The function uses OpenSSL's ``CRYPTO_memcmp()`` internally when
      available.

.. module:: html.entities
   :synopsis: Definitions of HTML general entities.

.. sectionauthor:: Fred L. Drake, Jr. <fdrake@acm.org>

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/html/entities.py`

--------------

This module defines four dictionaries, :data:`html5`,
:data:`name2codepoint`, :data:`codepoint2name`, and :data:`entitydefs`.


.. data:: html5

   A dictionary that maps HTML5 named character references [#]_ to the
   equivalent Unicode character(s), e.g. ``html5['gt;'] == '>'``.
   Note that the trailing semicolon is included in the name (e.g. ``'gt;'``),
   however some of the names are accepted by the standard even without the
   semicolon: in this case the name is present with and without the ``';'``.
   See also :func:`html.unescape`.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3


.. data:: entitydefs

   A dictionary mapping XHTML 1.0 entity definitions to their replacement text in
   ISO Latin-1.


.. data:: name2codepoint

   A dictionary that maps HTML4 entity names to the Unicode code points.


.. data:: codepoint2name

   A dictionary that maps Unicode code points to HTML4 entity names.

:mod:`!html.parser` --- Simple HTML and XHTML parser
====================================================

.. module:: html.parser
   :synopsis: A simple parser that can handle HTML and XHTML.

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/html/parser.py`

.. index::
   single: HTML
   single: XHTML

--------------

This module defines a class :class:`HTMLParser` which serves as the basis for
parsing text files formatted in HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language) and XHTML.

.. class:: HTMLParser(*, convert_charrefs=True)

   Create a parser instance able to parse invalid markup.

   If *convert_charrefs* is ``True`` (the default), all character
   references (except the ones in ``script``/``style`` elements) are
   automatically converted to the corresponding Unicode characters.

   An :class:`.HTMLParser` instance is fed HTML data and calls handler methods
   when start tags, end tags, text, comments, and other markup elements are
   encountered.  The user should subclass :class:`.HTMLParser` and override its
   methods to implement the desired behavior.

   This parser does not check that end tags match start tags or call the end-tag
   handler for elements which are closed implicitly by closing an outer element.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      *convert_charrefs* keyword argument added.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      The default value for argument *convert_charrefs* is now ``True``.


Example HTML Parser Application
-------------------------------

As a basic example, below is a simple HTML parser that uses the
:class:`HTMLParser` class to print out start tags, end tags, and data
as they are encountered::

   from html.parser import HTMLParser

   class MyHTMLParser(HTMLParser):
       def handle_starttag(self, tag, attrs):
           print("Encountered a start tag:", tag)

       def handle_endtag(self, tag):
           print("Encountered an end tag :", tag)

       def handle_data(self, data):
           print("Encountered some data  :", data)

   parser = MyHTMLParser()
   parser.feed('<html><head><title>Test</title></head>'
               '<body><h1>Parse me!</h1></body></html>')

The output will then be:

.. code-block:: none

   Encountered a start tag: html
   Encountered a start tag: head
   Encountered a start tag: title
   Encountered some data  : Test
   Encountered an end tag : title
   Encountered an end tag : head
   Encountered a start tag: body
   Encountered a start tag: h1
   Encountered some data  : Parse me!
   Encountered an end tag : h1
   Encountered an end tag : body
   Encountered an end tag : html


:class:`.HTMLParser` Methods
----------------------------

:class:`HTMLParser` instances have the following methods:


.. method:: HTMLParser.feed(data)

   Feed some text to the parser.  It is processed insofar as it consists of
   complete elements; incomplete data is buffered until more data is fed or
   :meth:`close` is called.  *data* must be :class:`str`.


.. method:: HTMLParser.close()

   Force processing of all buffered data as if it were followed by an end-of-file
   mark.  This method may be redefined by a derived class to define additional
   processing at the end of the input, but the redefined version should always call
   the :class:`HTMLParser` base class method :meth:`close`.


.. method:: HTMLParser.reset()

   Reset the instance.  Loses all unprocessed data.  This is called implicitly at
   instantiation time.


.. method:: HTMLParser.getpos()

   Return current line number and offset.


.. method:: HTMLParser.get_starttag_text()

   Return the text of the most recently opened start tag.  This should not normally
   be needed for structured processing, but may be useful in dealing with HTML "as
   deployed" or for re-generating input with minimal changes (whitespace between
   attributes can be preserved, etc.).


The following methods are called when data or markup elements are encountered
and they are meant to be overridden in a subclass.  The base class
implementations do nothing (except for :meth:`~HTMLParser.handle_startendtag`):


.. method:: HTMLParser.handle_starttag(tag, attrs)

   This method is called to handle the start tag of an element (e.g. ``<div id="main">``).

   The *tag* argument is the name of the tag converted to lower case. The *attrs*
   argument is a list of ``(name, value)`` pairs containing the attributes found
   inside the tag's ``<>`` brackets.  The *name* will be translated to lower case,
   and quotes in the *value* have been removed, and character and entity references
   have been replaced.

   For instance, for the tag ``<A HREF="https://www.cwi.nl/">``, this method
   would be called as ``handle_starttag('a', [('href', 'https://www.cwi.nl/')])``.

   All entity references from :mod:`html.entities` are replaced in the attribute
   values.


.. method:: HTMLParser.handle_endtag(tag)

   This method is called to handle the end tag of an element (e.g. ``</div>``).

   The *tag* argument is the name of the tag converted to lower case.


.. method:: HTMLParser.handle_startendtag(tag, attrs)

   Similar to :meth:`handle_starttag`, but called when the parser encounters an
   XHTML-style empty tag (``<img ... />``).  This method may be overridden by
   subclasses which require this particular lexical information; the default
   implementation simply calls :meth:`handle_starttag` and :meth:`handle_endtag`.


.. method:: HTMLParser.handle_data(data)

   This method is called to process arbitrary data (e.g. text nodes and the
   content of ``<script>...</script>`` and ``<style>...</style>``).


.. method:: HTMLParser.handle_entityref(name)

   This method is called to process a named character reference of the form
   ``&name;`` (e.g. ``&gt;``), where *name* is a general entity reference
   (e.g. ``'gt'``).  This method is never called if *convert_charrefs* is
   ``True``.


.. method:: HTMLParser.handle_charref(name)

   This method is called to process decimal and hexadecimal numeric character
   references of the form :samp:`&#{NNN};` and :samp:`&#x{NNN};`.  For example, the decimal
   equivalent for ``&gt;`` is ``&#62;``, whereas the hexadecimal is ``&#x3E;``;
   in this case the method will receive ``'62'`` or ``'x3E'``.  This method
   is never called if *convert_charrefs* is ``True``.


.. method:: HTMLParser.handle_comment(data)

   This method is called when a comment is encountered (e.g. ``<!--comment-->``).

   For example, the comment ``<!-- comment -->`` will cause this method to be
   called with the argument ``' comment '``.

   The content of Internet Explorer conditional comments (condcoms) will also be
   sent to this method, so, for ``<!--[if IE 9]>IE9-specific content<![endif]-->``,
   this method will receive ``'[if IE 9]>IE9-specific content<![endif]'``.


.. method:: HTMLParser.handle_decl(decl)

   This method is called to handle an HTML doctype declaration (e.g.
   ``<!DOCTYPE html>``).

   The *decl* parameter will be the entire contents of the declaration inside
   the ``<!...>`` markup (e.g. ``'DOCTYPE html'``).


.. method:: HTMLParser.handle_pi(data)

   Method called when a processing instruction is encountered.  The *data*
   parameter will contain the entire processing instruction. For example, for the
   processing instruction ``<?proc color='red'>``, this method would be called as
   ``handle_pi("proc color='red'")``.  It is intended to be overridden by a derived
   class; the base class implementation does nothing.

   .. note::

      The :class:`HTMLParser` class uses the SGML syntactic rules for processing
      instructions.  An XHTML processing instruction using the trailing ``'?'`` will
      cause the ``'?'`` to be included in *data*.


.. method:: HTMLParser.unknown_decl(data)

   This method is called when an unrecognized declaration is read by the parser.

   The *data* parameter will be the entire contents of the declaration inside
   the ``<![...]>`` markup.  It is sometimes useful to be overridden by a
   derived class.  The base class implementation does nothing.


.. _htmlparser-examples:

Examples
--------

The following class implements a parser that will be used to illustrate more
examples::

   from html.parser import HTMLParser
   from html.entities import name2codepoint

   class MyHTMLParser(HTMLParser):
       def handle_starttag(self, tag, attrs):
           print("Start tag:", tag)
           for attr in attrs:
               print("     attr:", attr)

       def handle_endtag(self, tag):
           print("End tag  :", tag)

       def handle_data(self, data):
           print("Data     :", data)

       def handle_comment(self, data):
           print("Comment  :", data)

       def handle_entityref(self, name):
           c = chr(name2codepoint[name])
           print("Named ent:", c)

       def handle_charref(self, name):
           if name.startswith('x'):
               c = chr(int(name[1:], 16))
           else:
               c = chr(int(name))
           print("Num ent  :", c)

       def handle_decl(self, data):
           print("Decl     :", data)

   parser = MyHTMLParser()

Parsing a doctype::

   >>> parser.feed('<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" '
   ...             '"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">')
   Decl     : DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"

Parsing an element with a few attributes and a title::

   >>> parser.feed('<img src="python-logo.png" alt="The Python logo">')
   Start tag: img
        attr: ('src', 'python-logo.png')
        attr: ('alt', 'The Python logo')
   >>>
   >>> parser.feed('<h1>Python</h1>')
   Start tag: h1
   Data     : Python
   End tag  : h1

The content of ``script`` and ``style`` elements is returned as is, without
further parsing::

   >>> parser.feed('<style type="text/css">#python { color: green }</style>')
   Start tag: style
        attr: ('type', 'text/css')
   Data     : #python { color: green }
   End tag  : style

   >>> parser.feed('<script type="text/javascript">'
   ...             'alert("<strong>hello!</strong>");</script>')
   Start tag: script
        attr: ('type', 'text/javascript')
   Data     : alert("<strong>hello!</strong>");
   End tag  : script

Parsing comments::

   >>> parser.feed('<!-- a comment -->'
   ...             '<!--[if IE 9]>IE-specific content<![endif]-->')
   Comment  :  a comment
   Comment  : [if IE 9]>IE-specific content<![endif]

Parsing named and numeric character references and converting them to the
correct char (note: these 3 references are all equivalent to ``'>'``)::

   >>> parser.feed('&gt;&#62;&#x3E;')
   Named ent: >
   Num ent  : >
   Num ent  : >

Feeding incomplete chunks to :meth:`~HTMLParser.feed` works, but
:meth:`~HTMLParser.handle_data` might be called more than once
(unless *convert_charrefs* is set to ``True``)::

   >>> for chunk in ['<sp', 'an>buff', 'ered ', 'text</s', 'pan>']:
   ...     parser.feed(chunk)
   ...
   Start tag: span
   Data     : buff
   Data     : ered
   Data     : text
   End tag  : span

Parsing invalid HTML (e.g. unquoted attributes) also works::

   >>> parser.feed('<p><a class=link href=#main>tag soup</p ></a>')
   Start tag: p
   Start tag: a
        attr: ('class', 'link')
        attr: ('href', '#main')
   Data     : tag soup
   End tag  : p
   End tag  : a

.. module:: html
   :synopsis: Helpers for manipulating HTML.

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/html/__init__.py`

--------------

This module defines utilities to manipulate HTML.

.. function:: escape(s, quote=True)

   Convert the characters ``&``, ``<`` and ``>`` in string *s* to HTML-safe
   sequences.  Use this if you need to display text that might contain such
   characters in HTML.  If the optional flag *quote* is true, the characters
   (``"``) and (``'``) are also translated; this helps for inclusion in an HTML
   attribute value delimited by quotes, as in ``<a href="...">``.

   .. versionadded:: 3.2


.. function:: unescape(s)

   Convert all named and numeric character references (e.g. ``&gt;``,
   ``&#62;``, ``&#x3e;``) in the string *s* to the corresponding Unicode
   characters.  This function uses the rules defined by the HTML 5 standard
   for both valid and invalid character references, and the :data:`list of
   HTML 5 named character references <html.entities.html5>`.

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

File: /Doc/library/http.client.rst
================================================
:mod:`!http.client` --- HTTP protocol client
============================================

.. module:: http.client
   :synopsis: HTTP and HTTPS protocol client (requires sockets).

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/http/client.py`

.. index::
   pair: HTTP; protocol
   single: HTTP; http.client (standard module)

.. index:: pair: module; urllib.request

--------------

This module defines classes that implement the client side of the HTTP and
HTTPS protocols.  It is normally not used directly --- the module
:mod:`urllib.request` uses it to handle URLs that use HTTP and HTTPS.

.. seealso::

    The `Requests package <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
    is recommended for a higher-level HTTP client interface.

.. note::

   HTTPS support is only available if Python was compiled with SSL support
   (through the :mod:`ssl` module).

.. include:: ../includes/wasm-notavail.rst

The module provides the following classes:


.. class:: HTTPConnection(host, port=None[, timeout], source_address=None, \
                          blocksize=8192)

   An :class:`HTTPConnection` instance represents one transaction with an HTTP
   server.  It should be instantiated by passing it a host and optional port
   number.  If no port number is passed, the port is extracted from the host
   string if it has the form ``host:port``, else the default HTTP port (80) is
   used.  If the optional *timeout* parameter is given, blocking
   operations (like connection attempts) will timeout after that many seconds
   (if it is not given, the global default timeout setting is used).
   The optional *source_address* parameter may be a tuple of a (host, port)
   to use as the source address the HTTP connection is made from.
   The optional *blocksize* parameter sets the buffer size in bytes for
   sending a file-like message body.

   For example, the following calls all create instances that connect to the server
   at the same host and port::

      >>> h1 = http.client.HTTPConnection('www.python.org')
      >>> h2 = http.client.HTTPConnection('www.python.org:80')
      >>> h3 = http.client.HTTPConnection('www.python.org', 80)
      >>> h4 = http.client.HTTPConnection('www.python.org', 80, timeout=10)

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2
      *source_address* was added.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      The  *strict* parameter was removed. HTTP 0.9-style "Simple Responses" are
      no longer supported.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.7
      *blocksize* parameter was added.


.. class:: HTTPSConnection(host, port=None, *[, timeout], \
                           source_address=None, context=None, \
                           blocksize=8192)

   A subclass of :class:`HTTPConnection` that uses SSL for communication with
   secure servers.  Default port is ``443``.  If *context* is specified, it
   must be a :class:`ssl.SSLContext` instance describing the various SSL
   options.

   Please read :ref:`ssl-security` for more information on best practices.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2
      *source_address*, *context* and *check_hostname* were added.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2
      This class now supports HTTPS virtual hosts if possible (that is,
      if :const:`ssl.HAS_SNI` is true).

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      The *strict* parameter was removed. HTTP 0.9-style "Simple Responses" are
      no longer supported.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4.3
      This class now performs all the necessary certificate and hostname checks
      by default. To revert to the previous, unverified, behavior
      :func:`!ssl._create_unverified_context` can be passed to the *context*
      parameter.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.8
      This class now enables TLS 1.3
      :attr:`ssl.SSLContext.post_handshake_auth` for the default *context* or
      when *cert_file* is passed with a custom *context*.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.10
      This class now sends an ALPN extension with protocol indicator
      ``http/1.1`` when no *context* is given. Custom *context* should set
      ALPN protocols with :meth:`~ssl.SSLContext.set_alpn_protocols`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.12
      The deprecated *key_file*, *cert_file* and *check_hostname* parameters
      have been removed.


.. class:: HTTPResponse(sock, debuglevel=0, method=None, url=None)

   Class whose instances are returned upon successful connection.  Not
   instantiated directly by user.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      The *strict* parameter was removed. HTTP 0.9 style "Simple Responses" are
      no longer supported.

This module provides the following function:

.. function:: parse_headers(fp)

   Parse the headers from a file pointer *fp* representing a HTTP
   request/response. The file has to be a :class:`~io.BufferedIOBase` reader
   (i.e. not text) and must provide a valid :rfc:`2822` style header.

   This function returns an instance of :class:`http.client.HTTPMessage`
   that holds the header fields, but no payload
   (the same as :attr:`HTTPResponse.msg`
   and :attr:`http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.headers`).
   After returning, the file pointer *fp* is ready to read the HTTP body.

   .. note::
      :meth:`parse_headers` does not parse the start-line of a HTTP message;
      it only parses the ``Name: value`` lines. The file has to be ready to
      read these field lines, so the first line should already be consumed
      before calling the function.

The following exceptions are raised as appropriate:


.. exception:: HTTPException

   The base class of the other exceptions in this module.  It is a subclass of
   :exc:`Exception`.


.. exception:: NotConnected

   A subclass of :exc:`HTTPException`.


.. exception:: InvalidURL

   A subclass of :exc:`HTTPException`, raised if a port is given and is either
   non-numeric or empty.


.. exception:: UnknownProtocol

   A subclass of :exc:`HTTPException`.


.. exception:: UnknownTransferEncoding

   A subclass of :exc:`HTTPException`.


.. exception:: UnimplementedFileMode

   A subclass of :exc:`HTTPException`.


.. exception:: IncompleteRead

   A subclass of :exc:`HTTPException`.


.. exception:: ImproperConnectionState

   A subclass of :exc:`HTTPException`.


.. exception:: CannotSendRequest

   A subclass of :exc:`ImproperConnectionState`.


.. exception:: CannotSendHeader

   A subclass of :exc:`ImproperConnectionState`.


.. exception:: ResponseNotReady

   A subclass of :exc:`ImproperConnectionState`.


.. exception:: BadStatusLine

   A subclass of :exc:`HTTPException`.  Raised if a server responds with a HTTP
   status code that we don't understand.


.. exception:: LineTooLong

   A subclass of :exc:`HTTPException`.  Raised if an excessively long line
   is received in the HTTP protocol from the server.


.. exception:: RemoteDisconnected

   A subclass of :exc:`ConnectionResetError` and :exc:`BadStatusLine`.  Raised
   by :meth:`HTTPConnection.getresponse` when the attempt to read the response
   results in no data read from the connection, indicating that the remote end
   has closed the connection.

   .. versionadded:: 3.5
      Previously, :exc:`BadStatusLine`\ ``('')`` was raised.


The constants defined in this module are:

.. data:: HTTP_PORT

   The default port for the HTTP protocol (always ``80``).

.. data:: HTTPS_PORT

   The default port for the HTTPS protocol (always ``443``).

.. data:: responses

   This dictionary maps the HTTP 1.1 status codes to the W3C names.

   Example: ``http.client.responses[http.client.NOT_FOUND]`` is ``'Not Found'``.

See :ref:`http-status-codes` for a list of HTTP status codes that are
available in this module as constants.


.. _httpconnection-objects:

HTTPConnection Objects
----------------------

:class:`HTTPConnection` instances have the following methods:


.. method:: HTTPConnection.request(method, url, body=None, headers={}, *, \
            encode_chunked=False)

   This will send a request to the server using the HTTP request
   method *method* and the request URI *url*. The provided *url* must be
   an absolute path to conform with :rfc:`RFC 2616 §5.1.2 <2616#section-5.1.2>`
   (unless connecting to an HTTP proxy server or using the ``OPTIONS`` or
   ``CONNECT`` methods).

   If *body* is specified, the specified data is sent after the headers are
   finished.  It may be a :class:`str`, a :term:`bytes-like object`, an
   open :term:`file object`, or an iterable of :class:`bytes`.  If *body*
   is a string, it is encoded as ISO-8859-1, the default for HTTP.  If it
   is a bytes-like object, the bytes are sent as is.  If it is a :term:`file
   object`, the contents of the file is sent; this file object should
   support at least the ``read()`` method.  If the file object is an
   instance of :class:`io.TextIOBase`, the data returned by the ``read()``
   method will be encoded as ISO-8859-1, otherwise the data returned by
   ``read()`` is sent as is.  If *body* is an iterable, the elements of the
   iterable are sent as is until the iterable is exhausted.

   The *headers* argument should be a mapping of extra HTTP headers to send
   with the request. A :rfc:`Host header <2616#section-14.23>`
   must be provided to conform with :rfc:`RFC 2616 §5.1.2 <2616#section-5.1.2>`
   (unless connecting to an HTTP proxy server or using the ``OPTIONS`` or
   ``CONNECT`` methods).

   If *headers* contains neither Content-Length nor Transfer-Encoding,
   but there is a request body, one of those
   header fields will be added automatically.  If
   *body* is ``None``, the Content-Length header is set to ``0`` for
   methods that expect a body (``PUT``, ``POST``, and ``PATCH``).  If
   *body* is a string or a bytes-like object that is not also a
   :term:`file <file object>`, the Content-Length header is
   set to its length.  Any other type of *body* (files
   and iterables in general) will be chunk-encoded, and the
   Transfer-Encoding header will automatically be set instead of
   Content-Length.

   The *encode_chunked* argument is only relevant if Transfer-Encoding is
   specified in *headers*.  If *encode_chunked* is ``False``, the
   HTTPConnection object assumes that all encoding is handled by the
   calling code.  If it is ``True``, the body will be chunk-encoded.

   For example, to perform a ``GET`` request to ``https://docs.python.org/3/``::

      >>> import http.client
      >>> host = "docs.python.org"
      >>> conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection(host)
      >>> conn.request("GET", "/3/", headers={"Host": host})
      >>> response = conn.getresponse()
      >>> print(response.status, response.reason)
      200 OK

   .. note::
      Chunked transfer encoding has been added to the HTTP protocol
      version 1.1.  Unless the HTTP server is known to handle HTTP 1.1,
      the caller must either specify the Content-Length, or must pass a
      :class:`str` or bytes-like object that is not also a file as the
      body representation.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2
      *body* can now be an iterable.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6
      If neither Content-Length nor Transfer-Encoding are set in
      *headers*, file and iterable *body* objects are now chunk-encoded.
      The *encode_chunked* argument was added.
      No attempt is made to determine the Content-Length for file
      objects.

.. method:: HTTPConnection.getresponse()

   Should be called after a request is sent to get the response from the server.
   Returns an :class:`HTTPResponse` instance.

   .. note::

      Note that you must have read the whole response before you can send a new
      request to the server.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      If a :exc:`ConnectionError` or subclass is raised, the
      :class:`HTTPConnection` object will be ready to reconnect when
      a new request is sent.


.. method:: HTTPConnection.set_debuglevel(level)

   Set the debugging level.  The default debug level is ``0``, meaning no
   debugging output is printed.  Any value greater than ``0`` will cause all
   currently defined debug output to be printed to stdout.  The ``debuglevel``
   is passed to any new :class:`HTTPResponse` objects that are created.

   .. versionadded:: 3.1


.. method:: HTTPConnection.set_tunnel(host, port=None, headers=None)

   Set the host and the port for HTTP Connect Tunnelling. This allows running
   the connection through a proxy server.

   The *host* and *port* arguments specify the endpoint of the tunneled connection
   (i.e. the address included in the CONNECT request, *not* the address of the
   proxy server).

   The *headers* argument should be a mapping of extra HTTP headers to send with
   the CONNECT request.

   As HTTP/1.1 is used for HTTP CONNECT tunnelling request, `as per the RFC
   <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.6>`_, a HTTP ``Host:``
   header must be provided, matching the authority-form of the request target
   provided as the destination for the CONNECT request. If a HTTP ``Host:``
   header is not provided via the headers argument, one is generated and
   transmitted automatically.

   For example, to tunnel through a HTTPS proxy server running locally on port
   8080, we would pass the address of the proxy to the :class:`HTTPSConnection`
   constructor, and the address of the host that we eventually want to reach to
   the :meth:`~HTTPConnection.set_tunnel` method::

      >>> import http.client
      >>> conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("localhost", 8080)
      >>> conn.set_tunnel("www.python.org")
      >>> conn.request("HEAD","/index.html")

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

   .. versionchanged:: 3.12
      HTTP CONNECT tunnelling requests use protocol HTTP/1.1, upgraded from
      protocol HTTP/1.0. ``Host:`` HTTP headers are mandatory for HTTP/1.1, so
      one will be automatically generated and transmitted if not provided in
      the headers argument.


.. method:: HTTPConnection.get_proxy_response_headers()

   Returns a dictionary with the headers of the response received from
   the proxy server to the CONNECT request.

   If the CONNECT request was not sent, the method returns ``None``.

   .. versionadded:: 3.12


.. method:: HTTPConnection.connect()

   Connect to the server specified when the object was created.  By default,
   this is called automatically when making a request if the client does not
   already have a connection.

   .. audit-event:: http.client.connect self,host,port http.client.HTTPConnection.connect


.. method:: HTTPConnection.close()

   Close the connection to the server.


.. attribute:: HTTPConnection.blocksize

   Buffer size in bytes for sending a file-like message body.

   .. versionadded:: 3.7


As an alternative to using the :meth:`~HTTPConnection.request` method described above, you can
also send your request step by step, by using the four functions below.


.. method:: HTTPConnection.putrequest(method, url, skip_host=False, \
                                      skip_accept_encoding=False)

   This should be the first call after the connection to the server has been
   made. It sends a line to the server consisting of the *method* string,
   the *url* string, and the HTTP version (``HTTP/1.1``).  To disable automatic
   sending of ``Host:`` or ``Accept-Encoding:`` headers (for example to accept
   additional content encodings), specify *skip_host* or *skip_accept_encoding*
   with non-False values.


.. method:: HTTPConnection.putheader(header, argument[, ...])

   Send an :rfc:`822`\ -style header to the server.  It sends a line to the server
   consisting of the header, a colon and a space, and the first argument.  If more
   arguments are given, continuation lines are sent, each consisting of a tab and
   an argument.


.. method:: HTTPConnection.endheaders(message_body=None, *, encode_chunked=False)

   Send a blank line to the server, signalling the end of the headers. The
   optional *message_body* argument can be used to pass a message body
   associated with the request.

   If *encode_chunked* is ``True``, the result of each iteration of
   *message_body* will be chunk-encoded as specified in :rfc:`7230`,
   Section 3.3.1.  How the data is encoded is dependent on the type of
   *message_body*.  If *message_body* implements the :ref:`buffer interface
   <bufferobjects>` the encoding will result in a single chunk.
   If *message_body* is a :class:`collections.abc.Iterable`, each iteration
   of *message_body* will result in a chunk.  If *message_body* is a
   :term:`file object`, each call to ``.read()`` will result in a chunk.
   The method automatically signals the end of the chunk-encoded data
   immediately after *message_body*.

   .. note:: Due to the chunked encoding specification, empty chunks
      yielded by an iterator body will be ignored by the chunk-encoder.
      This is to avoid premature termination of the read of the request by
      the target server due to malformed encoding.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6
      Added chunked encoding support and the *encode_chunked* parameter.


.. method:: HTTPConnection.send(data)

   Send data to the server.  This should be used directly only after the
   :meth:`endheaders` method has been called and before :meth:`getresponse` is
   called.

   .. audit-event:: http.client.send self,data http.client.HTTPConnection.send


.. _httpresponse-objects:

HTTPResponse Objects
--------------------

An :class:`HTTPResponse` instance wraps the HTTP response from the
server.  It provides access to the request headers and the entity
body.  The response is an iterable object and can be used in a with
statement.

.. versionchanged:: 3.5
   The :class:`io.BufferedIOBase` interface is now implemented and
   all of its reader operations are supported.


.. method:: HTTPResponse.read([amt])

   Reads and returns the response body, or up to the next *amt* bytes.

.. method:: HTTPResponse.readinto(b)

   Reads up to the next len(b) bytes of the response body into the buffer *b*.
   Returns the number of bytes read.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3

.. method:: HTTPResponse.getheader(name, default=None)

   Return the value of the header *name*, or *default* if there is no header
   matching *name*.  If there is more than one  header with the name *name*,
   return all of the values joined by ', '.  If *default* is any iterable other
   than a single string, its elements are similarly returned joined by commas.

.. method:: HTTPResponse.getheaders()

   Return a list of (header, value) tuples.

.. method:: HTTPResponse.fileno()

   Return the ``fileno`` of the underlying socket.

.. attribute:: HTTPResponse.msg

   A :class:`http.client.HTTPMessage` instance containing the response
   headers.  :class:`http.client.HTTPMessage` is a subclass of
   :class:`email.message.Message`.

.. attribute:: HTTPResponse.version

   HTTP protocol version used by server.  10 for HTTP/1.0, 11 for HTTP/1.1.

.. attribute:: HTTPResponse.url

   URL of the resource retrieved, commonly used to determine if a redirect was followed.

.. attribute:: HTTPResponse.headers

   Headers of the response in the form of an :class:`email.message.EmailMessage` instance.

.. attribute:: HTTPResponse.status

   Status code returned by server.

.. attribute:: HTTPResponse.reason

   Reason phrase returned by server.

.. attribute:: HTTPResponse.debuglevel

   A debugging hook.  If :attr:`debuglevel` is greater than zero, messages
   will be printed to stdout as the response is read and parsed.

.. attribute:: HTTPResponse.closed

   Is ``True`` if the stream is closed.

.. method:: HTTPResponse.geturl()

   .. deprecated:: 3.9
      Deprecated in favor of :attr:`~HTTPResponse.url`.

.. method:: HTTPResponse.info()

   .. deprecated:: 3.9
      Deprecated in favor of :attr:`~HTTPResponse.headers`.

.. method:: HTTPResponse.getcode()

   .. deprecated:: 3.9
      Deprecated in favor of :attr:`~HTTPResponse.status`.

Examples
--------

Here is an example session that uses the ``GET`` method::

   >>> import http.client
   >>> conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("www.python.org")
   >>> conn.request("GET", "/")
   >>> r1 = conn.getresponse()
   >>> print(r1.status, r1.reason)
   200 OK
   >>> data1 = r1.read()  # This will return entire content.
   >>> # The following example demonstrates reading data in chunks.
   >>> conn.request("GET", "/")
   >>> r1 = conn.getresponse()
   >>> while chunk := r1.read(200):
   ...     print(repr(chunk))
   b'<!doctype html>\n<!--[if"...
   ...
   >>> # Example of an invalid request
   >>> conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("docs.python.org")
   >>> conn.request("GET", "/parrot.spam")
   >>> r2 = conn.getresponse()
   >>> print(r2.status, r2.reason)
   404 Not Found
   >>> data2 = r2.read()
   >>> conn.close()

Here is an example session that uses the ``HEAD`` method.  Note that the
``HEAD`` method never returns any data. ::

   >>> import http.client
   >>> conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("www.python.org")
   >>> conn.request("HEAD", "/")
   >>> res = conn.getresponse()
   >>> print(res.status, res.reason)
   200 OK
   >>> data = res.read()
   >>> print(len(data))
   0
   >>> data == b''
   True

Here is an example session that uses the ``POST`` method::

   >>> import http.client, urllib.parse
   >>> params = urllib.parse.urlencode({'@number': 12524, '@type': 'issue', '@action': 'show'})
   >>> headers = {"Content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
   ...            "Accept": "text/plain"}
   >>> conn = http.client.HTTPConnection("bugs.python.org")
   >>> conn.request("POST", "", params, headers)
   >>> response = conn.getresponse()
   >>> print(response.status, response.reason)
   302 Found
   >>> data = response.read()
   >>> data
   b'Redirecting to <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue12524">https://bugs.python.org/issue12524</a>'
   >>> conn.close()

Client side HTTP ``PUT`` requests are very similar to ``POST`` requests. The
difference lies only on the server side where HTTP servers will allow resources to
be created via ``PUT`` requests. It should be noted that custom HTTP methods
are also handled in :class:`urllib.request.Request` by setting the appropriate
method attribute. Here is an example session that uses the ``PUT`` method::

    >>> # This creates an HTTP request
    >>> # with the content of BODY as the enclosed representation
    >>> # for the resource http://localhost:8080/file
    ...
    >>> import http.client
    >>> BODY = "***filecontents***"
    >>> conn = http.client.HTTPConnection("localhost", 8080)
    >>> conn.request("PUT", "/file", BODY)
    >>> response = conn.getresponse()
    >>> print(response.status, response.reason)
    200, OK

.. _httpmessage-objects:

HTTPMessage Objects
-------------------

.. class:: HTTPMessage(email.message.Message)

An :class:`http.client.HTTPMessage` instance holds the headers from an HTTP
response.  It is implemented using the :class:`email.message.Message` class.

.. XXX Define the methods that clients can depend upon between versions.

:mod:`!http.cookiejar` --- Cookie handling for HTTP clients
===========================================================

.. module:: http.cookiejar
   :synopsis: Classes for automatic handling of HTTP cookies.

.. moduleauthor:: John J. Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
.. sectionauthor:: John J. Lee <jjl@pobox.com>

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/http/cookiejar.py`

--------------

The :mod:`http.cookiejar` module defines classes for automatic handling of HTTP
cookies.  It is useful for accessing web sites that require small pieces of data
-- :dfn:`cookies` -- to be set on the client machine by an HTTP response from a
web server, and then returned to the server in later HTTP requests.

Both the regular Netscape cookie protocol and the protocol defined by
:rfc:`2965` are handled.  RFC 2965 handling is switched off by default.
:rfc:`2109` cookies are parsed as Netscape cookies and subsequently treated
either as Netscape or RFC 2965 cookies according to the 'policy' in effect.
Note that the great majority of cookies on the internet are Netscape cookies.
:mod:`http.cookiejar` attempts to follow the de-facto Netscape cookie protocol (which
differs substantially from that set out in the original Netscape specification),
including taking note of the ``max-age`` and ``port`` cookie-attributes
introduced with RFC 2965.

.. note::

   The various named parameters found in :mailheader:`Set-Cookie` and
   :mailheader:`Set-Cookie2` headers (eg. ``domain`` and ``expires``) are
   conventionally referred to as :dfn:`attributes`.  To distinguish them from
   Python attributes, the documentation for this module uses the term
   :dfn:`cookie-attribute` instead.


The module defines the following exception:


.. exception:: LoadError

   Instances of :class:`FileCookieJar` raise this exception on failure to load
   cookies from a file.  :exc:`LoadError` is a subclass of :exc:`OSError`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      :exc:`LoadError` used to be a subtype of :exc:`IOError`, which is now an
      alias of :exc:`OSError`.


The following classes are provided:


.. class:: CookieJar(policy=None)

   *policy* is an object implementing the :class:`CookiePolicy` interface.

   The :class:`CookieJar` class stores HTTP cookies.  It extracts cookies from HTTP
   requests, and returns them in HTTP responses. :class:`CookieJar` instances
   automatically expire contained cookies when necessary.  Subclasses are also
   responsible for storing and retrieving cookies from a file or database.


.. class:: FileCookieJar(filename=None, delayload=None, policy=None)

   *policy* is an object implementing the :class:`CookiePolicy` interface.  For the
   other arguments, see the documentation for the corresponding attributes.

   A :class:`CookieJar` which can load cookies from, and perhaps save cookies to, a
   file on disk.  Cookies are **NOT** loaded from the named file until either the
   :meth:`load` or :meth:`revert` method is called.  Subclasses of this class are
   documented in section :ref:`file-cookie-jar-classes`.

   This should not be initialized directly – use its subclasses below instead.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.8

      The filename parameter supports a :term:`path-like object`.


.. class:: CookiePolicy()

   This class is responsible for deciding whether each cookie should be accepted
   from / returned to the server.


.. class:: DefaultCookiePolicy( blocked_domains=None, allowed_domains=None, netscape=True, rfc2965=False, rfc2109_as_netscape=None, hide_cookie2=False, strict_domain=False, strict_rfc2965_unverifiable=True, strict_ns_unverifiable=False, strict_ns_domain=DefaultCookiePolicy.DomainLiberal, strict_ns_set_initial_dollar=False, strict_ns_set_path=False, secure_protocols=("https", "wss") )

   Constructor arguments should be passed as keyword arguments only.
   *blocked_domains* is a sequence of domain names that we never accept cookies
   from, nor return cookies to. *allowed_domains* if not :const:`None`, this is a
   sequence of the only domains for which we accept and return cookies.
   *secure_protocols* is a sequence of protocols for which secure cookies can be
   added to. By default *https* and *wss* (secure websocket) are considered
   secure protocols. For all other arguments, see the documentation for
   :class:`CookiePolicy` and :class:`DefaultCookiePolicy` objects.

   :class:`DefaultCookiePolicy` implements the standard accept / reject rules for
   Netscape and :rfc:`2965` cookies.  By default, :rfc:`2109` cookies (ie. cookies
   received in a :mailheader:`Set-Cookie` header with a version cookie-attribute of
   1) are treated according to the RFC 2965 rules.  However, if RFC 2965 handling
   is turned off or :attr:`rfc2109_as_netscape` is ``True``, RFC 2109 cookies are
   'downgraded' by the :class:`CookieJar` instance to Netscape cookies, by
   setting the :attr:`version` attribute of the :class:`Cookie` instance to 0.
   :class:`DefaultCookiePolicy` also provides some parameters to allow some
   fine-tuning of policy.


.. class:: Cookie()

   This class represents Netscape, :rfc:`2109` and :rfc:`2965` cookies.  It is not
   expected that users of :mod:`http.cookiejar` construct their own :class:`Cookie`
   instances.  Instead, if necessary, call :meth:`make_cookies` on a
   :class:`CookieJar` instance.


.. seealso::

   Module :mod:`urllib.request`
      URL opening with automatic cookie handling.

   Module :mod:`http.cookies`
      HTTP cookie classes, principally useful for server-side code.  The
      :mod:`http.cookiejar` and :mod:`http.cookies` modules do not depend on each
      other.

   https://curl.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html
      The specification of the original Netscape cookie protocol.  Though this is
      still the dominant protocol, the 'Netscape cookie protocol' implemented by all
      the major browsers (and :mod:`http.cookiejar`) only bears a passing resemblance to
      the one sketched out in ``cookie_spec.html``.

   :rfc:`2109` - HTTP State Management Mechanism
      Obsoleted by :rfc:`2965`. Uses :mailheader:`Set-Cookie` with version=1.

   :rfc:`2965` - HTTP State Management Mechanism
      The Netscape protocol with the bugs fixed.  Uses :mailheader:`Set-Cookie2` in
      place of :mailheader:`Set-Cookie`.  Not widely used.

.. _cookie-jar-objects:

CookieJar and FileCookieJar Objects
-----------------------------------

:class:`CookieJar` objects support the :term:`iterator` protocol for iterating over
contained :class:`Cookie` objects.

:class:`CookieJar` has the following methods:


.. method:: CookieJar.add_cookie_header(request)

   Add correct :mailheader:`Cookie` header to *request*.

   If policy allows (ie. the :attr:`rfc2965` and :attr:`hide_cookie2` attributes of
   the :class:`CookieJar`'s :class:`CookiePolicy` instance are true and false
   respectively), the :mailheader:`Cookie2` header is also added when appropriate.

   The *request* object (usually a :class:`urllib.request.Request` instance)
   must support the methods :meth:`get_full_url`, :meth:`has_header`,
   :meth:`get_header`, :meth:`header_items`, :meth:`add_unredirected_header`
   and the attributes :attr:`host`, :attr:`!type`, :attr:`unverifiable`
   and :attr:`origin_req_host` as documented by :mod:`urllib.request`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3

    *request* object needs :attr:`origin_req_host` attribute. Dependency on a
    deprecated method :meth:`get_origin_req_host` has been removed.


.. method:: CookieJar.extract_cookies(response, request)

   Extract cookies from HTTP *response* and store them in the :class:`CookieJar`,
   where allowed by policy.

   The :class:`CookieJar` will look for allowable :mailheader:`Set-Cookie` and
   :mailheader:`Set-Cookie2` headers in the *response* argument, and store cookies
   as appropriate (subject to the :meth:`CookiePolicy.set_ok` method's approval).

   The *response* object (usually the result of a call to
   :meth:`urllib.request.urlopen`, or similar) should support an :meth:`info`
   method, which returns an :class:`email.message.Message` instance.

   The *request* object (usually a :class:`urllib.request.Request` instance)
   must support the method :meth:`get_full_url` and the attributes
   :attr:`host`, :attr:`unverifiable` and :attr:`origin_req_host`,
   as documented by :mod:`urllib.request`.  The request is used to set
   default values for cookie-attributes as well as for checking that the
   cookie is allowed to be set.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3

    *request* object needs :attr:`origin_req_host` attribute. Dependency on a
    deprecated method :meth:`get_origin_req_host` has been removed.

.. method:: CookieJar.set_policy(policy)

   Set the :class:`CookiePolicy` instance to be used.


.. method:: CookieJar.make_cookies(response, request)

   Return sequence of :class:`Cookie` objects extracted from *response* object.

   See the documentation for :meth:`extract_cookies` for the interfaces required of
   the *response* and *request* arguments.


.. method:: CookieJar.set_cookie_if_ok(cookie, request)

   Set a :class:`Cookie` if policy says it's OK to do so.


.. method:: CookieJar.set_cookie(cookie)

   Set a :class:`Cookie`, without checking with policy to see whether or not it
   should be set.


.. method:: CookieJar.clear([domain[, path[, name]]])

   Clear some cookies.

   If invoked without arguments, clear all cookies.  If given a single argument,
   only cookies belonging to that *domain* will be removed. If given two arguments,
   cookies belonging to the specified *domain* and URL *path* are removed.  If
   given three arguments, then the cookie with the specified *domain*, *path* and
   *name* is removed.

   Raises :exc:`KeyError` if no matching cookie exists.


.. method:: CookieJar.clear_session_cookies()

   Discard all session cookies.

   Discards all contained cookies that have a true :attr:`discard` attribute
   (usually because they had either no ``max-age`` or ``expires`` cookie-attribute,
   or an explicit ``discard`` cookie-attribute).  For interactive browsers, the end
   of a session usually corresponds to closing the browser window.

   Note that the :meth:`save` method won't save session cookies anyway, unless you
   ask otherwise by passing a true *ignore_discard* argument.

:class:`FileCookieJar` implements the following additional methods:


.. method:: FileCookieJar.save(filename=None, ignore_discard=False, ignore_expires=False)

   Save cookies to a file.

   This base class raises :exc:`NotImplementedError`.  Subclasses may leave this
   method unimplemented.

   *filename* is the name of file in which to save cookies.  If *filename* is not
   specified, :attr:`self.filename` is used (whose default is the value passed to
   the constructor, if any); if :attr:`self.filename` is :const:`None`,
   :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

   *ignore_discard*: save even cookies set to be discarded. *ignore_expires*: save
   even cookies that have expired

   The file is overwritten if it already exists, thus wiping all the cookies it
   contains.  Saved cookies can be restored later using the :meth:`load` or
   :meth:`revert` methods.


.. method:: FileCookieJar.load(filename=None, ignore_discard=False, ignore_expires=False)

   Load cookies from a file.

   Old cookies are kept unless overwritten by newly loaded ones.

   Arguments are as for :meth:`save`.

   The named file must be in the format understood by the class, or
   :exc:`LoadError` will be raised.  Also, :exc:`OSError` may be raised, for
   example if the file does not exist.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      :exc:`IOError` used to be raised, it is now an alias of :exc:`OSError`.


.. method:: FileCookieJar.revert(filename=None, ignore_discard=False, ignore_expires=False)

   Clear all cookies and reload cookies from a saved file.

   :meth:`revert` can raise the same exceptions as :meth:`load`. If there is a
   failure, the object's state will not be altered.

:class:`FileCookieJar` instances have the following public attributes:


.. attribute:: FileCookieJar.filename

   Filename of default file in which to keep cookies.  This attribute may be
   assigned to.


.. attribute:: FileCookieJar.delayload

   If true, load cookies lazily from disk.  This attribute should not be assigned
   to.  This is only a hint, since this only affects performance, not behaviour
   (unless the cookies on disk are changing). A :class:`CookieJar` object may
   ignore it.  None of the :class:`FileCookieJar` classes included in the standard
   library lazily loads cookies.


.. _file-cookie-jar-classes:

FileCookieJar subclasses and co-operation with web browsers
-----------------------------------------------------------

The following :class:`CookieJar` subclasses are provided for reading and
writing.

.. class:: MozillaCookieJar(filename=None, delayload=None, policy=None)

   A :class:`FileCookieJar` that can load from and save cookies to disk in the
   Mozilla ``cookies.txt`` file format (which is also used by curl and the Lynx
   and Netscape browsers).

   .. note::

      This loses information about :rfc:`2965` cookies, and also about newer or
      non-standard cookie-attributes such as ``port``.

   .. warning::

      Back up your cookies before saving if you have cookies whose loss / corruption
      would be inconvenient (there are some subtleties which may lead to slight
      changes in the file over a load / save round-trip).

   Also note that cookies saved while Mozilla is running will get clobbered by
   Mozilla.


.. class:: LWPCookieJar(filename=None, delayload=None, policy=None)

   A :class:`FileCookieJar` that can load from and save cookies to disk in format
   compatible with the libwww-perl library's ``Set-Cookie3`` file format.  This is
   convenient if you want to store cookies in a human-readable file.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.8

      The filename parameter supports a :term:`path-like object`.

.. _cookie-policy-objects:

CookiePolicy Objects
--------------------

Objects implementing the :class:`CookiePolicy` interface have the following
methods:


.. method:: CookiePolicy.set_ok(cookie, request)

   Return boolean value indicating whether cookie should be accepted from server.

   *cookie* is a :class:`Cookie` instance.  *request* is an object
   implementing the interface defined by the documentation for
   :meth:`CookieJar.extract_cookies`.


.. method:: CookiePolicy.return_ok(cookie, request)

   Return boolean value indicating whether cookie should be returned to server.

   *cookie* is a :class:`Cookie` instance.  *request* is an object
   implementing the interface defined by the documentation for
   :meth:`CookieJar.add_cookie_header`.


.. method:: CookiePolicy.domain_return_ok(domain, request)

   Return ``False`` if cookies should not be returned, given cookie domain.

   This method is an optimization.  It removes the need for checking every cookie
   with a particular domain (which might involve reading many files).  Returning
   true from :meth:`domain_return_ok` and :meth:`path_return_ok` leaves all the
   work to :meth:`return_ok`.

   If :meth:`domain_return_ok` returns true for the cookie domain,
   :meth:`path_return_ok` is called for the cookie path.  Otherwise,
   :meth:`path_return_ok` and :meth:`return_ok` are never called for that cookie
   domain.  If :meth:`path_return_ok` returns true, :meth:`return_ok` is called
   with the :class:`Cookie` object itself for a full check.  Otherwise,
   :meth:`return_ok` is never called for that cookie path.

   Note that :meth:`domain_return_ok` is called for every *cookie* domain, not just
   for the *request* domain.  For example, the function might be called with both
   ``".example.com"`` and ``"www.example.com"`` if the request domain is
   ``"www.example.com"``.  The same goes for :meth:`path_return_ok`.

   The *request* argument is as documented for :meth:`return_ok`.


.. method:: CookiePolicy.path_return_ok(path, request)

   Return ``False`` if cookies should not be returned, given cookie path.

   See the documentation for :meth:`domain_return_ok`.

In addition to implementing the methods above, implementations of the
:class:`CookiePolicy` interface must also supply the following attributes,
indicating which protocols should be used, and how.  All of these attributes may
be assigned to.


.. attribute:: CookiePolicy.netscape

   Implement Netscape protocol.


.. attribute:: CookiePolicy.rfc2965

   Implement :rfc:`2965` protocol.


.. attribute:: CookiePolicy.hide_cookie2

   Don't add :mailheader:`Cookie2` header to requests (the presence of this header
   indicates to the server that we understand :rfc:`2965` cookies).

The most useful way to define a :class:`CookiePolicy` class is by subclassing
from :class:`DefaultCookiePolicy` and overriding some or all of the methods
above.  :class:`CookiePolicy` itself may be used as a 'null policy' to allow
setting and receiving any and all cookies (this is unlikely to be useful).


.. _default-cookie-policy-objects:

DefaultCookiePolicy Objects
---------------------------

Implements the standard rules for accepting and returning cookies.

Both :rfc:`2965` and Netscape cookies are covered.  RFC 2965 handling is switched
off by default.

The easiest way to provide your own policy is to override this class and call
its methods in your overridden implementations before adding your own additional
checks::

   import http.cookiejar
   class MyCookiePolicy(http.cookiejar.DefaultCookiePolicy):
       def set_ok(self, cookie, request):
           if not http.cookiejar.DefaultCookiePolicy.set_ok(self, cookie, request):
               return False
           if i_dont_want_to_store_this_cookie(cookie):
               return False
           return True

In addition to the features required to implement the :class:`CookiePolicy`
interface, this class allows you to block and allow domains from setting and
receiving cookies.  There are also some strictness switches that allow you to
tighten up the rather loose Netscape protocol rules a little bit (at the cost of
blocking some benign cookies).

A domain blocklist and allowlist is provided (both off by default). Only domains
not in the blocklist and present in the allowlist (if the allowlist is active)
participate in cookie setting and returning.  Use the *blocked_domains*
constructor argument, and :meth:`blocked_domains` and
:meth:`set_blocked_domains` methods (and the corresponding argument and methods
for *allowed_domains*).  If you set an allowlist, you can turn it off again by
setting it to :const:`None`.

Domains in block or allow lists that do not start with a dot must equal the
cookie domain to be matched.  For example, ``"example.com"`` matches a blocklist
entry of ``"example.com"``, but ``"www.example.com"`` does not.  Domains that do
start with a dot are matched by more specific domains too. For example, both
``"www.example.com"`` and ``"www.coyote.example.com"`` match ``".example.com"``
(but ``"example.com"`` itself does not).  IP addresses are an exception, and
must match exactly.  For example, if blocked_domains contains ``"192.168.1.2"``
and ``".168.1.2"``, 192.168.1.2 is blocked, but 193.168.1.2 is not.

:class:`DefaultCookiePolicy` implements the following additional methods:


.. method:: DefaultCookiePolicy.blocked_domains()

   Return the sequence of blocked domains (as a tuple).


.. method:: DefaultCookiePolicy.set_blocked_domains(blocked_domains)

   Set the sequence of blocked domains.


.. method:: DefaultCookiePolicy.is_blocked(domain)

   Return ``True`` if *domain* is on the blocklist for setting or receiving
   cookies.


.. method:: DefaultCookiePolicy.allowed_domains()

   Return :const:`None`, or the sequence of allowed domains (as a tuple).


.. method:: DefaultCookiePolicy.set_allowed_domains(allowed_domains)

   Set the sequence of allowed domains, or :const:`None`.


.. method:: DefaultCookiePolicy.is_not_allowed(domain)

   Return ``True`` if *domain* is not on the allowlist for setting or receiving
   cookies.

:class:`DefaultCookiePolicy` instances have the following attributes, which are
all initialised from the constructor arguments of the same name, and which may
all be assigned to.


.. attribute:: DefaultCookiePolicy.rfc2109_as_netscape

   If true, request that the :class:`CookieJar` instance downgrade :rfc:`2109` cookies
   (ie. cookies received in a :mailheader:`Set-Cookie` header with a version
   cookie-attribute of 1) to Netscape cookies by setting the version attribute of
   the :class:`Cookie` instance to 0.  The default value is :const:`None`, in which
   case RFC 2109 cookies are downgraded if and only if :rfc:`2965` handling is turned
   off.  Therefore, RFC 2109 cookies are downgraded by default.


General strictness switches:

.. attribute:: DefaultCookiePolicy.strict_domain

   Don't allow sites to set two-component domains with country-code top-level
   domains like ``.co.uk``, ``.gov.uk``, ``.co.nz``.etc.  This is far from perfect
   and isn't guaranteed to work!


:rfc:`2965` protocol strictness switches:

.. attribute:: DefaultCookiePolicy.strict_rfc2965_unverifiable

   Follow :rfc:`2965` rules on unverifiable transactions (usually, an unverifiable
   transaction is one resulting from a redirect or a request for an image hosted on
   another site).  If this is false, cookies are *never* blocked on the basis of
   verifiability


Netscape protocol strictness switches:

.. attribute:: DefaultCookiePolicy.strict_ns_unverifiable

   Apply :rfc:`2965` rules on unverifiable transactions even to Netscape cookies.


.. attribute:: DefaultCookiePolicy.strict_ns_domain

   Flags indicating how strict to be with domain-matching rules for Netscape
   cookies.  See below for acceptable values.


.. attribute:: DefaultCookiePolicy.strict_ns_set_initial_dollar

   Ignore cookies in Set-Cookie: headers that have names starting with ``'$'``.


.. attribute:: DefaultCookiePolicy.strict_ns_set_path

   Don't allow setting cookies whose path doesn't path-match request URI.

:attr:`strict_ns_domain` is a collection of flags.  Its value is constructed by
or-ing together (for example, ``DomainStrictNoDots|DomainStrictNonDomain`` means
both flags are set).


.. attribute:: DefaultCookiePolicy.DomainStrictNoDots

   When setting cookies, the 'host prefix' must not contain a dot (eg.
   ``www.foo.bar.com`` can't set a cookie for ``.bar.com``, because ``www.foo``
   contains a dot).


.. attribute:: DefaultCookiePolicy.DomainStrictNonDomain

   Cookies that did not explicitly specify a ``domain`` cookie-attribute can only
   be returned to a domain equal to the domain that set the cookie (eg.
   ``spam.example.com`` won't be returned cookies from ``example.com`` that had no
   ``domain`` cookie-attribute).


.. attribute:: DefaultCookiePolicy.DomainRFC2965Match

   When setting cookies, require a full :rfc:`2965` domain-match.

The following attributes are provided for convenience, and are the most useful
combinations of the above flags:


.. attribute:: DefaultCookiePolicy.DomainLiberal

   Equivalent to 0 (ie. all of the above Netscape domain strictness flags switched
   off).


.. attribute:: DefaultCookiePolicy.DomainStrict

   Equivalent to ``DomainStrictNoDots|DomainStrictNonDomain``.


Cookie Objects
--------------

:class:`Cookie` instances have Python attributes roughly corresponding to the
standard cookie-attributes specified in the various cookie standards.  The
correspondence is not one-to-one, because there are complicated rules for
assigning default values, because the ``max-age`` and ``expires``
cookie-attributes contain equivalent information, and because :rfc:`2109` cookies
may be 'downgraded' by :mod:`http.cookiejar` from version 1 to version 0 (Netscape)
cookies.

Assignment to these attributes should not be necessary other than in rare
circumstances in a :class:`CookiePolicy` method.  The class does not enforce
internal consistency, so you should know what you're doing if you do that.


.. attribute:: Cookie.version

   Integer or :const:`None`.  Netscape cookies have :attr:`version` 0. :rfc:`2965` and
   :rfc:`2109` cookies have a ``version`` cookie-attribute of 1.  However, note that
   :mod:`http.cookiejar` may 'downgrade' RFC 2109 cookies to Netscape cookies, in which
   case :attr:`version` is 0.


.. attribute:: Cookie.name

   Cookie name (a string).


.. attribute:: Cookie.value

   Cookie value (a string), or :const:`None`.


.. attribute:: Cookie.port

   String representing a port or a set of ports (eg. '80', or '80,8080'), or
   :const:`None`.


.. attribute:: Cookie.domain

   Cookie domain (a string).


.. attribute:: Cookie.path

   Cookie path (a string, eg. ``'/acme/rocket_launchers'``).


.. attribute:: Cookie.secure

   ``True`` if cookie should only be returned over a secure connection.


.. attribute:: Cookie.expires

   Integer expiry date in seconds since epoch, or :const:`None`.  See also the
   :meth:`is_expired` method.


.. attribute:: Cookie.discard

   ``True`` if this is a session cookie.


.. attribute:: Cookie.comment

   String comment from the server explaining the function of this cookie, or
   :const:`None`.


.. attribute:: Cookie.comment_url

   URL linking to a comment from the server explaining the function of this cookie,
   or :const:`None`.


.. attribute:: Cookie.rfc2109

   ``True`` if this cookie was received as an :rfc:`2109` cookie (ie. the cookie
   arrived in a :mailheader:`Set-Cookie` header, and the value of the Version
   cookie-attribute in that header was 1).  This attribute is provided because
   :mod:`http.cookiejar` may 'downgrade' RFC 2109 cookies to Netscape cookies, in
   which case :attr:`version` is 0.


.. attribute:: Cookie.port_specified

   ``True`` if a port or set of ports was explicitly specified by the server (in the
   :mailheader:`Set-Cookie` / :mailheader:`Set-Cookie2` header).


.. attribute:: Cookie.domain_specified

   ``True`` if a domain was explicitly specified by the server.


.. attribute:: Cookie.domain_initial_dot

   ``True`` if the domain explicitly specified by the server began with a dot
   (``'.'``).

Cookies may have additional non-standard cookie-attributes.  These may be
accessed using the following methods:


.. method:: Cookie.has_nonstandard_attr(name)

   Return ``True`` if cookie has the named cookie-attribute.


.. method:: Cookie.get_nonstandard_attr(name, default=None)

   If cookie has the named cookie-attribute, return its value. Otherwise, return
   *default*.


.. method:: Cookie.set_nonstandard_attr(name, value)

   Set the value of the named cookie-attribute.

The :class:`Cookie` class also defines the following method:


.. method:: Cookie.is_expired(now=None)

   ``True`` if cookie has passed the time at which the server requested it should
   expire.  If *now* is given (in seconds since the epoch), return whether the
   cookie has expired at the specified time.


Examples
--------

The first example shows the most common usage of :mod:`http.cookiejar`::

   import http.cookiejar, urllib.request
   cj = http.cookiejar.CookieJar()
   opener = urllib.request.build_opener(urllib.request.HTTPCookieProcessor(cj))
   r = opener.open("http://example.com/")

This example illustrates how to open a URL using your Netscape, Mozilla, or Lynx
cookies (assumes Unix/Netscape convention for location of the cookies file)::

   import os, http.cookiejar, urllib.request
   cj = http.cookiejar.MozillaCookieJar()
   cj.load(os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), ".netscape", "cookies.txt"))
   opener = urllib.request.build_opener(urllib.request.HTTPCookieProcessor(cj))
   r = opener.open("http://example.com/")

The next example illustrates the use of :class:`DefaultCookiePolicy`. Turn on
:rfc:`2965` cookies, be more strict about domains when setting and returning
Netscape cookies, and block some domains from setting cookies or having them
returned::

   import urllib.request
   from http.cookiejar import CookieJar, DefaultCookiePolicy
   policy = DefaultCookiePolicy(
       rfc2965=True, strict_ns_domain=Policy.DomainStrict,
       blocked_domains=["ads.net", ".ads.net"])
   cj = CookieJar(policy)
   opener = urllib.request.build_opener(urllib.request.HTTPCookieProcessor(cj))
   r = opener.open("http://example.com/")

:mod:`!http.cookies` --- HTTP state management
==============================================

.. module:: http.cookies
   :synopsis: Support for HTTP state management (cookies).

.. moduleauthor:: Timothy O'Malley <timo@alum.mit.edu>
.. sectionauthor:: Moshe Zadka <moshez@zadka.site.co.il>

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/http/cookies.py`

--------------

The :mod:`http.cookies` module defines classes for abstracting the concept of
cookies, an HTTP state management mechanism. It supports both simple string-only
cookies, and provides an abstraction for having any serializable data-type as
cookie value.

The module formerly strictly applied the parsing rules described in the
:rfc:`2109` and :rfc:`2068` specifications.  It has since been discovered that
MSIE 3.0x didn't follow the character rules outlined in those specs; many
current-day browsers and servers have also relaxed parsing rules when it comes
to cookie handling.  As a result, this module now uses parsing rules that are a
bit less strict than they once were.

The character set, :data:`string.ascii_letters`, :data:`string.digits` and
``!#$%&'*+-.^_`|~:`` denote the set of valid characters allowed by this module
in a cookie name (as :attr:`~Morsel.key`).

.. versionchanged:: 3.3
   Allowed ':' as a valid cookie name character.


.. note::

   On encountering an invalid cookie, :exc:`CookieError` is raised, so if your
   cookie data comes from a browser you should always prepare for invalid data
   and catch :exc:`CookieError` on parsing.


.. exception:: CookieError

   Exception failing because of :rfc:`2109` invalidity: incorrect attributes,
   incorrect :mailheader:`Set-Cookie` header, etc.


.. class:: BaseCookie([input])

   This class is a dictionary-like object whose keys are strings and whose values
   are :class:`Morsel` instances. Note that upon setting a key to a value, the
   value is first converted to a :class:`Morsel` containing the key and the value.

   If *input* is given, it is passed to the :meth:`load` method.


.. class:: SimpleCookie([input])

   This class derives from :class:`BaseCookie` and overrides :meth:`~BaseCookie.value_decode`
   and :meth:`~BaseCookie.value_encode`. :class:`!SimpleCookie` supports
   strings as cookie values. When setting the value, :class:`!SimpleCookie`
   calls the builtin :func:`str` to convert
   the value to a string. Values received from HTTP are kept as strings.

.. seealso::

   Module :mod:`http.cookiejar`
      HTTP cookie handling for web *clients*.  The :mod:`http.cookiejar` and
      :mod:`http.cookies` modules do not depend on each other.

   :rfc:`2109` - HTTP State Management Mechanism
      This is the state management specification implemented by this module.


.. _cookie-objects:

Cookie Objects
--------------


.. method:: BaseCookie.value_decode(val)

   Return a tuple ``(real_value, coded_value)`` from a string representation.
   ``real_value`` can be any type. This method does no decoding in
   :class:`BaseCookie` --- it exists so it can be overridden.


.. method:: BaseCookie.value_encode(val)

   Return a tuple ``(real_value, coded_value)``. *val* can be any type, but
   ``coded_value`` will always be converted to a string.
   This method does no encoding in :class:`BaseCookie` --- it exists so it can
   be overridden.

   In general, it should be the case that :meth:`value_encode` and
   :meth:`value_decode` are inverses on the range of *value_decode*.


.. method:: BaseCookie.output(attrs=None, header='Set-Cookie:', sep='\r\n')

   Return a string representation suitable to be sent as HTTP headers. *attrs* and
   *header* are sent to each :class:`Morsel`'s :meth:`~Morsel.output` method. *sep* is used
   to join the headers together, and is by default the combination ``'\r\n'``
   (CRLF).


.. method:: BaseCookie.js_output(attrs=None)

   Return an embeddable JavaScript snippet, which, if run on a browser which
   supports JavaScript, will act the same as if the HTTP headers was sent.

   The meaning for *attrs* is the same as in :meth:`output`.


.. method:: BaseCookie.load(rawdata)

   If *rawdata* is a string, parse it as an ``HTTP_COOKIE`` and add the values
   found there as :class:`Morsel`\ s. If it is a dictionary, it is equivalent to::

      for k, v in rawdata.items():
          cookie[k] = v


.. _morsel-objects:

Morsel Objects
--------------


.. class:: Morsel

   Abstract a key/value pair, which has some :rfc:`2109` attributes.

   Morsels are dictionary-like objects, whose set of keys is constant --- the valid
   :rfc:`2109` attributes, which are:

     .. attribute:: expires
                    path
                    comment
                    domain
                    max-age
                    secure
                    version
                    httponly
                    samesite

   The attribute :attr:`httponly` specifies that the cookie is only transferred
   in HTTP requests, and is not accessible through JavaScript. This is intended
   to mitigate some forms of cross-site scripting.

   The attribute :attr:`samesite` specifies that the browser is not allowed to
   send the cookie along with cross-site requests. This helps to mitigate CSRF
   attacks. Valid values for this attribute are "Strict" and "Lax".

   The keys are case-insensitive and their default value is ``''``.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      :meth:`!__eq__` now takes :attr:`~Morsel.key` and :attr:`~Morsel.value`
      into account.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.7
      Attributes :attr:`~Morsel.key`, :attr:`~Morsel.value` and
      :attr:`~Morsel.coded_value` are read-only.  Use :meth:`~Morsel.set` for
      setting them.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.8
      Added support for the :attr:`samesite` attribute.


.. attribute:: Morsel.value

   The value of the cookie.


.. attribute:: Morsel.coded_value

   The encoded value of the cookie --- this is what should be sent.


.. attribute:: Morsel.key

   The name of the cookie.


.. method:: Morsel.set(key, value, coded_value)

   Set the *key*, *value* and *coded_value* attributes.


.. method:: Morsel.isReservedKey(K)

   Whether *K* is a member of the set of keys of a :class:`Morsel`.


.. method:: Morsel.output(attrs=None, header='Set-Cookie:')

   Return a string representation of the Morsel, suitable to be sent as an HTTP
   header. By default, all the attributes are included, unless *attrs* is given, in
   which case it should be a list of attributes to use. *header* is by default
   ``"Set-Cookie:"``.


.. method:: Morsel.js_output(attrs=None)

   Return an embeddable JavaScript snippet, which, if run on a browser which
   supports JavaScript, will act the same as if the HTTP header was sent.

   The meaning for *attrs* is the same as in :meth:`output`.


.. method:: Morsel.OutputString(attrs=None)

   Return a string representing the Morsel, without any surrounding HTTP or
   JavaScript.

   The meaning for *attrs* is the same as in :meth:`output`.


.. method:: Morsel.update(values)

   Update the values in the Morsel dictionary with the values in the dictionary
   *values*.  Raise an error if any of the keys in the *values* dict is not a
   valid :rfc:`2109` attribute.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      an error is raised for invalid keys.


.. method:: Morsel.copy(value)

   Return a shallow copy of the Morsel object.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      return a Morsel object instead of a dict.


.. method:: Morsel.setdefault(key, value=None)

   Raise an error if key is not a valid :rfc:`2109` attribute, otherwise
   behave the same as :meth:`dict.setdefault`.


.. _cookie-example:

:mod:`http` is a package that collects several modules for working with the
HyperText Transfer Protocol:

* :mod:`http.client` is a low-level HTTP protocol client; for high-level URL
  opening use :mod:`urllib.request`
* :mod:`http.server` contains basic HTTP server classes based on :mod:`socketserver`
* :mod:`http.cookies` has utilities for implementing state management with cookies
* :mod:`http.cookiejar` provides persistence of cookies


The :mod:`http` module also defines the following enums that help you work with http related code:

.. class:: HTTPStatus

   .. versionadded:: 3.5

   A subclass of :class:`enum.IntEnum` that defines a set of HTTP status codes,
   reason phrases and long descriptions written in English.

   Usage::

      >>> from http import HTTPStatus
      >>> HTTPStatus.OK
      HTTPStatus.OK
      >>> HTTPStatus.OK == 200
      True
      >>> HTTPStatus.OK.value

======= =================================== ==================================================================

In order to preserve backwards compatibility, enum values are also present
in the :mod:`http.client` module in the form of constants. The enum name is
equal to the constant name (i.e. ``http.HTTPStatus.OK`` is also available as
``http.client.OK``).

.. versionchanged:: 3.7
   Added ``421 MISDIRECTED_REQUEST`` status code.

.. versionadded:: 3.8
   Added ``451 UNAVAILABLE_FOR_LEGAL_REASONS`` status code.

.. versionadded:: 3.9
   Added ``103 EARLY_HINTS``, ``418 IM_A_TEAPOT`` and ``425 TOO_EARLY`` status codes.

.. versionchanged:: 3.13
   Implemented RFC9110 naming for status constants. Old constant names are preserved for
   backwards compatibility.

HTTP status category
--------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.12

The enum values have several properties to indicate the HTTP status category:

.. module:: http.server
   :synopsis: HTTP server and request handlers.

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/http/server.py`

.. index::
   pair: WWW; server
   pair: HTTP; protocol
   single: URL
   single: httpd

--------------

This module defines classes for implementing HTTP servers.


.. warning::

    :mod:`http.server` is not recommended for production. It only implements
    :ref:`basic security checks <http.server-security>`.

.. include:: ../includes/wasm-notavail.rst

One class, :class:`HTTPServer`, is a :class:`socketserver.TCPServer` subclass.
It creates and listens at the HTTP socket, dispatching the requests to a
handler.  Code to create and run the server looks like this::

   def run(server_class=HTTPServer, handler_class=BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
       server_address = ('', 8000)
       httpd = server_class(server_address, handler_class)
       httpd.serve_forever()


.. class:: HTTPServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass)

   This class builds on the :class:`~socketserver.TCPServer` class by storing
   the server address as instance variables named :attr:`server_name` and
   :attr:`server_port`. The server is accessible by the handler, typically
   through the handler's :attr:`server` instance variable.

.. class:: ThreadingHTTPServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass)

   This class is identical to HTTPServer but uses threads to handle
   requests by using the :class:`~socketserver.ThreadingMixIn`. This
   is useful to handle web browsers pre-opening sockets, on which
   :class:`HTTPServer` would wait indefinitely.

   .. versionadded:: 3.7


The :class:`HTTPServer` and :class:`ThreadingHTTPServer` must be given
a *RequestHandlerClass* on instantiation, of which this module
provides three different variants:

.. class:: BaseHTTPRequestHandler(request, client_address, server)

   This class is used to handle the HTTP requests that arrive at the server.  By
   itself, it cannot respond to any actual HTTP requests; it must be subclassed
   to handle each request method (e.g. GET or POST).
   :class:`BaseHTTPRequestHandler` provides a number of class and instance
   variables, and methods for use by subclasses.

   The handler will parse the request and the headers, then call a method
   specific to the request type. The method name is constructed from the
   request. For example, for the request method ``SPAM``, the :meth:`!do_SPAM`
   method will be called with no arguments. All of the relevant information is
   stored in instance variables of the handler.  Subclasses should not need to
   override or extend the :meth:`!__init__` method.

   :class:`BaseHTTPRequestHandler` has the following instance variables:

   .. attribute:: client_address

      Contains a tuple of the form ``(host, port)`` referring to the client's
      address.

   .. attribute:: server

      Contains the server instance.

   .. attribute:: close_connection

      Boolean that should be set before :meth:`handle_one_request` returns,
      indicating if another request may be expected, or if the connection should
      be shut down.

   .. attribute:: requestline

      Contains the string representation of the HTTP request line. The
      terminating CRLF is stripped. This attribute should be set by
      :meth:`handle_one_request`. If no valid request line was processed, it
      should be set to the empty string.

   .. attribute:: command

      Contains the command (request type). For example, ``'GET'``.

   .. attribute:: path

      Contains the request path. If query component of the URL is present,
      then ``path`` includes the query. Using the terminology of :rfc:`3986`,
      ``path`` here includes ``hier-part`` and the ``query``.

   .. attribute:: request_version

      Contains the version string from the request. For example, ``'HTTP/1.0'``.

   .. attribute:: headers

      Holds an instance of the class specified by the :attr:`MessageClass` class
      variable. This instance parses and manages the headers in the HTTP
      request. The :func:`~http.client.parse_headers` function from
      :mod:`http.client` is used to parse the headers and it requires that the
      HTTP request provide a valid :rfc:`2822` style header.

   .. attribute:: rfile

      An :class:`io.BufferedIOBase` input stream, ready to read from
      the start of the optional input data.

   .. attribute:: wfile

      Contains the output stream for writing a response back to the
      client. Proper adherence to the HTTP protocol must be used when writing to
      this stream in order to achieve successful interoperation with HTTP
      clients.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.6
         This is an :class:`io.BufferedIOBase` stream.

   :class:`BaseHTTPRequestHandler` has the following attributes:

   .. attribute:: server_version

      Specifies the server software version.  You may want to override this. The
      format is multiple whitespace-separated strings, where each string is of
      the form name[/version]. For example, ``'BaseHTTP/0.2'``.

   .. attribute:: sys_version

      Contains the Python system version, in a form usable by the
      :attr:`version_string` method and the :attr:`server_version` class
      variable. For example, ``'Python/1.4'``.

   .. attribute:: error_message_format

      Specifies a format string that should be used by :meth:`send_error` method
      for building an error response to the client. The string is filled by
      default with variables from :attr:`responses` based on the status code
      that passed to :meth:`send_error`.

   .. attribute:: error_content_type

      Specifies the Content-Type HTTP header of error responses sent to the
      client.  The default value is ``'text/html'``.

   .. attribute:: protocol_version

      Specifies the HTTP version to which the server is conformant. It is sent
      in responses to let the client know the server's communication
      capabilities for future requests. If set to
      ``'HTTP/1.1'``, the server will permit HTTP persistent connections;
      however, your server *must* then include an accurate ``Content-Length``
      header (using :meth:`send_header`) in all of its responses to clients.
      For backwards compatibility, the setting defaults to ``'HTTP/1.0'``.

   .. attribute:: MessageClass

      Specifies an :class:`email.message.Message`\ -like class to parse HTTP
      headers.  Typically, this is not overridden, and it defaults to
      :class:`http.client.HTTPMessage`.

   .. attribute:: responses

      This attribute contains a mapping of error code integers to two-element tuples
      containing a short and long message. For example, ``{code: (shortmessage,
      longmessage)}``. The *shortmessage* is usually used as the *message* key in an
      error response, and *longmessage* as the *explain* key.  It is used by
      :meth:`send_response_only` and :meth:`send_error` methods.

   A :class:`BaseHTTPRequestHandler` instance has the following methods:

   .. method:: handle()

      Calls :meth:`handle_one_request` once (or, if persistent connections are
      enabled, multiple times) to handle incoming HTTP requests. You should
      never need to override it; instead, implement appropriate :meth:`!do_\*`
      methods.

   .. method:: handle_one_request()

      This method will parse and dispatch the request to the appropriate
      :meth:`!do_\*` method.  You should never need to override it.

   .. method:: handle_expect_100()

      When an HTTP/1.1 conformant server receives an ``Expect: 100-continue``
      request header it responds back with a ``100 Continue`` followed by ``200
      OK`` headers.
      This method can be overridden to raise an error if the server does not
      want the client to continue.  For e.g. server can choose to send ``417
      Expectation Failed`` as a response header and ``return False``.

      .. versionadded:: 3.2

   .. method:: send_error(code, message=None, explain=None)

      Sends and logs a complete error reply to the client. The numeric *code*
      specifies the HTTP error code, with *message* as an optional, short, human
      readable description of the error.  The *explain* argument can be used to
      provide more detailed information about the error; it will be formatted
      using the :attr:`error_message_format` attribute and emitted, after
      a complete set of headers, as the response body.  The :attr:`responses`
      attribute holds the default values for *message* and *explain* that
      will be used if no value is provided; for unknown codes the default value
      for both is the string ``???``. The body will be empty if the method is
      HEAD or the response code is one of the following: :samp:`1{xx}`,
      ``204 No Content``, ``205 Reset Content``, ``304 Not Modified``.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.4
         The error response includes a Content-Length header.
         Added the *explain* argument.

   .. method:: send_response(code, message=None)

      Adds a response header to the headers buffer and logs the accepted
      request. The HTTP response line is written to the internal buffer,
      followed by *Server* and *Date* headers. The values for these two headers
      are picked up from the :meth:`version_string` and
      :meth:`date_time_string` methods, respectively. If the server does not
      intend to send any other headers using the :meth:`send_header` method,
      then :meth:`send_response` should be followed by an :meth:`end_headers`
      call.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.3
         Headers are stored to an internal buffer and :meth:`end_headers`
         needs to be called explicitly.

   .. method:: send_header(keyword, value)

      Adds the HTTP header to an internal buffer which will be written to the
      output stream when either :meth:`end_headers` or :meth:`flush_headers` is
      invoked. *keyword* should specify the header keyword, with *value*
      specifying its value. Note that, after the send_header calls are done,
      :meth:`end_headers` MUST BE called in order to complete the operation.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.2
         Headers are stored in an internal buffer.

   .. method:: send_response_only(code, message=None)

      Sends the response header only, used for the purposes when ``100
      Continue`` response is sent by the server to the client. The headers not
      buffered and sent directly the output stream.If the *message* is not
      specified, the HTTP message corresponding the response *code*  is sent.

      .. versionadded:: 3.2

   .. method:: end_headers()

      Adds a blank line
      (indicating the end of the HTTP headers in the response)
      to the headers buffer and calls :meth:`flush_headers`.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.2
         The buffered headers are written to the output stream.

   .. method:: flush_headers()

      Finally send the headers to the output stream and flush the internal
      headers buffer.

      .. versionadded:: 3.3

   .. method:: log_request(code='-', size='-')

      Logs an accepted (successful) request. *code* should specify the numeric
      HTTP code associated with the response. If a size of the response is
      available, then it should be passed as the *size* parameter.

   .. method:: log_error(...)

      Logs an error when a request cannot be fulfilled. By default, it passes
      the message to :meth:`log_message`, so it takes the same arguments
      (*format* and additional values).


   .. method:: log_message(format, ...)

      Logs an arbitrary message to ``sys.stderr``. This is typically overridden
      to create custom error logging mechanisms. The *format* argument is a
      standard printf-style format string, where the additional arguments to
      :meth:`log_message` are applied as inputs to the formatting. The client
      ip address and current date and time are prefixed to every message logged.

   .. method:: version_string()

      Returns the server software's version string. This is a combination of the
      :attr:`server_version` and :attr:`sys_version` attributes.

   .. method:: date_time_string(timestamp=None)

      Returns the date and time given by *timestamp* (which must be ``None`` or in
      the format returned by :func:`time.time`), formatted for a message
      header. If *timestamp* is omitted, it uses the current date and time.

      The result looks like ``'Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT'``.

   .. method:: log_date_time_string()

      Returns the current date and time, formatted for logging.

   .. method:: address_string()

      Returns the client address.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.3
         Previously, a name lookup was performed. To avoid name resolution
         delays, it now always returns the IP address.


.. class:: SimpleHTTPRequestHandler(request, client_address, server, directory=None)

   This class serves files from the directory *directory* and below,
   or the current directory if *directory* is not provided, directly
   mapping the directory structure to HTTP requests.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.7
      Added the *directory* parameter.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.9
      The *directory* parameter accepts a :term:`path-like object`.

   A lot of the work, such as parsing the request, is done by the base class
   :class:`BaseHTTPRequestHandler`.  This class implements the :func:`do_GET`
   and :func:`do_HEAD` functions.

   The following are defined as class-level attributes of
   :class:`SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`:

   .. attribute:: server_version

      This will be ``"SimpleHTTP/" + __version__``, where ``__version__`` is
      defined at the module level.

   .. attribute:: extensions_map

      A dictionary mapping suffixes into MIME types, contains custom overrides
      for the default system mappings. The mapping is used case-insensitively,
      and so should contain only lower-cased keys.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.9
         This dictionary is no longer filled with the default system mappings,
         but only contains overrides.

   The :class:`SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` class defines the following methods:

   .. method:: do_HEAD()

      This method serves the ``'HEAD'`` request type: it sends the headers it
      would send for the equivalent ``GET`` request. See the :meth:`do_GET`
      method for a more complete explanation of the possible headers.

   .. method:: do_GET()

      The request is mapped to a local file by interpreting the request as a
      path relative to the current working directory.

      If the request was mapped to a directory, the directory is checked for a
      file named ``index.html`` or ``index.htm`` (in that order). If found, the
      file's contents are returned; otherwise a directory listing is generated
      by calling the :meth:`list_directory` method. This method uses
      :func:`os.listdir` to scan the directory, and returns a ``404`` error
      response if the :func:`~os.listdir` fails.

      If the request was mapped to a file, it is opened. Any :exc:`OSError`
      exception in opening the requested file is mapped to a ``404``,
      ``'File not found'`` error. If there was an ``'If-Modified-Since'``
      header in the request, and the file was not modified after this time,
      a ``304``, ``'Not Modified'`` response is sent. Otherwise, the content
      type is guessed by calling the :meth:`guess_type` method, which in turn
      uses the *extensions_map* variable, and the file contents are returned.

      A ``'Content-type:'`` header with the guessed content type is output,
      followed by a ``'Content-Length:'`` header with the file's size and a
      ``'Last-Modified:'`` header with the file's modification time.

      Then follows a blank line signifying the end of the headers, and then the
      contents of the file are output. If the file's MIME type starts with
      ``text/`` the file is opened in text mode; otherwise binary mode is used.

      For example usage, see the implementation of the ``test`` function
      in :source:`Lib/http/server.py`.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.7
         Support of the ``'If-Modified-Since'`` header.

The :class:`SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` class can be used in the following
manner in order to create a very basic webserver serving files relative to
the current directory::

   import http.server
   import socketserver

   PORT = 8000

   Handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

   with socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), Handler) as httpd:
       print("serving at port", PORT)
       httpd.serve_forever()


:class:`SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` can also be subclassed to enhance behavior,
such as using different index file names by overriding the class attribute
:attr:`index_pages`.

.. _http-server-cli:

:mod:`http.server` can also be invoked directly using the :option:`-m`
switch of the interpreter.  Similar to
the previous example, this serves files relative to the current directory::

        python -m http.server

The server listens to port 8000 by default. The default can be overridden
by passing the desired port number as an argument::

        python -m http.server 9000

By default, the server binds itself to all interfaces.  The option ``-b/--bind``
specifies a specific address to which it should bind. Both IPv4 and IPv6
addresses are supported. For example, the following command causes the server
to bind to localhost only::

        python -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1

.. versionchanged:: 3.4
   Added the ``--bind`` option.

.. versionchanged:: 3.8
   Support IPv6 in the ``--bind`` option.

By default, the server uses the current directory. The option ``-d/--directory``
specifies a directory to which it should serve the files. For example,
the following command uses a specific directory::

        python -m http.server --directory /tmp/

.. versionchanged:: 3.7
   Added the ``--directory`` option.

By default, the server is conformant to HTTP/1.0. The option ``-p/--protocol``
specifies the HTTP version to which the server is conformant. For example, the
following command runs an HTTP/1.1 conformant server::

        python -m http.server --protocol HTTP/1.1

.. versionchanged:: 3.11
   Added the ``--protocol`` option.

.. class:: CGIHTTPRequestHandler(request, client_address, server)

   This class is used to serve either files or output of CGI scripts from the
   current directory and below. Note that mapping HTTP hierarchic structure to
   local directory structure is exactly as in :class:`SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`.

   .. note::

      CGI scripts run by the :class:`CGIHTTPRequestHandler` class cannot execute
      redirects (HTTP code 302), because code 200 (script output follows) is
      sent prior to execution of the CGI script.  This pre-empts the status
      code.

   The class will however, run the CGI script, instead of serving it as a file,
   if it guesses it to be a CGI script.  Only directory-based CGI are used ---
   the other common server configuration is to treat special extensions as
   denoting CGI scripts.

   The :func:`do_GET` and :func:`do_HEAD` functions are modified to run CGI scripts
   and serve the output, instead of serving files, if the request leads to
   somewhere below the ``cgi_directories`` path.

   The :class:`CGIHTTPRequestHandler` defines the following data member:

   .. attribute:: cgi_directories

      This defaults to ``['/cgi-bin', '/htbin']`` and describes directories to
      treat as containing CGI scripts.

   The :class:`CGIHTTPRequestHandler` defines the following method:

   .. method:: do_POST()

      This method serves the ``'POST'`` request type, only allowed for CGI
      scripts.  Error 501, "Can only POST to CGI scripts", is output when trying
      to POST to a non-CGI url.

   Note that CGI scripts will be run with UID of user nobody, for security
   reasons.  Problems with the CGI script will be translated to error 403.

   .. deprecated-removed:: 3.13 3.15

      :class:`CGIHTTPRequestHandler` is being removed in 3.15.  CGI has not
      been considered a good way to do things for well over a decade. This code
      has been unmaintained for a while now and sees very little practical use.
      Retaining it could lead to further :ref:`security considerations
      <http.server-security>`.

:class:`CGIHTTPRequestHandler` can be enabled in the command line by passing
the ``--cgi`` option::

        python -m http.server --cgi

.. deprecated-removed:: 3.13 3.15

   :mod:`http.server` command line ``--cgi`` support is being removed
   because :class:`CGIHTTPRequestHandler` is being removed.

.. warning::

   :class:`CGIHTTPRequestHandler` and the ``--cgi`` command line option
   are not intended for use by untrusted clients and may be vulnerable
   to exploitation. Always use within a secure environment.

.. _http.server-security:

Security Considerations
-----------------------

.. index:: pair: http.server; security

:class:`SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` will follow symbolic links when handling
requests, this makes it possible for files outside of the specified directory
to be served.

Earlier versions of Python did not scrub control characters from the
log messages emitted to stderr from ``python -m http.server`` or the
default :class:`BaseHTTPRequestHandler` ``.log_message``
implementation. This could allow remote clients connecting to your
server to send nefarious control codes to your terminal.

.. versionchanged:: 3.12
   Control characters are scrubbed in stderr logs.

.. moduleauthor:: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/idlelib/`

.. index::
   single: IDLE
   single: Python Editor
   single: Integrated Development Environment

--------------

IDLE is Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment.

IDLE has the following features:

* cross-platform: works mostly the same on Windows, Unix, and macOS

* Python shell window (interactive interpreter) with colorizing
  of code input, output, and error messages

* multi-window text editor with multiple undo, Python colorizing,
  smart indent, call tips, auto completion, and other features

* search within any window, replace within editor windows, and search
  through multiple files (grep)

* debugger with persistent breakpoints, stepping, and viewing
  of global and local namespaces

* configuration, browsers, and other dialogs

Menus
-----

IDLE has two main window types, the Shell window and the Editor window.  It is
possible to have multiple editor windows simultaneously.  On Windows and
Linux, each has its own top menu.  Each menu documented below indicates
which window type it is associated with.

Output windows, such as used for Edit => Find in Files, are a subtype of editor
window.  They currently have the same top menu but a different
default title and context menu.

On macOS, there is one application menu.  It dynamically changes according
to the window currently selected.  It has an IDLE menu, and some entries
described below are moved around to conform to Apple guidelines.

File menu (Shell and Editor)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New File
   Create a new file editing window.

Open...
   Open an existing file with an Open dialog.

Open Module...
   Open an existing module (searches sys.path).

Recent Files
   Open a list of recent files.  Click one to open it.

.. index::
   single: Module browser
   single: Path browser

Module Browser
   Show functions, classes, and methods in the current Editor file in a
   tree structure.  In the shell, open a module first.

Path Browser
   Show sys.path directories, modules, functions, classes and methods in a
   tree structure.

Save
   Save the current window to the associated file, if there is one.  Windows
   that have been changed since being opened or last saved have a \* before
   and after the window title.  If there is no associated file,
   do Save As instead.

Save As...
   Save the current window with a Save As dialog.  The file saved becomes the
   new associated file for the window. (If your file namager is set to hide
   extensions, the current extension will be omitted in the file name box.
   If the new filename has no '.', '.py' and '.txt' will be added for Python
   and text files, except that on macOS Aqua,'.py' is added for all files.)

Save Copy As...
   Save the current window to different file without changing the associated
   file.  (See Save As note above about filename extensions.)

Print Window
   Print the current window to the default printer.

Close Window
   Close the current window (if an unsaved editor, ask to save; if an unsaved
   Shell, ask to quit execution).  Calling ``exit()`` or ``close()`` in the Shell
   window also closes Shell.  If this is the only window, also exit IDLE.

Exit IDLE
   Close all windows and quit IDLE (ask to save unsaved edit windows).

Edit menu (Shell and Editor)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Undo
   Undo the last change to the current window.  A maximum of 1000 changes may
   be undone.

Redo
   Redo the last undone change to the current window.

Select All
   Select the entire contents of the current window.

Cut
   Copy selection into the system-wide clipboard; then delete the selection.

Copy
   Copy selection into the system-wide clipboard.

Paste
   Insert contents of the system-wide clipboard into the current window.

The clipboard functions are also available in context menus.

Find...
   Open a search dialog with many options

Find Again
   Repeat the last search, if there is one.

Find Selection
   Search for the currently selected string, if there is one.

Find in Files...
   Open a file search dialog.  Put results in a new output window.

Replace...
   Open a search-and-replace dialog.

Go to Line
   Move the cursor to the beginning of the line requested and make that
   line visible.  A request past the end of the file goes to the end.
   Clear any selection and update the line and column status.

Show Completions
   Open a scrollable list allowing selection of existing names. See
   :ref:`Completions <completions>` in the Editing and navigation section below.

Expand Word
   Expand a prefix you have typed to match a full word in the same window;
   repeat to get a different expansion.

Show Call Tip
   After an unclosed parenthesis for a function, open a small window with
   function parameter hints.  See :ref:`Calltips <calltips>` in the
   Editing and navigation section below.

Show Surrounding Parens
   Highlight the surrounding parenthesis.

.. _format-menu:

Format menu (Editor window only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Format Paragraph
   Reformat the current blank-line-delimited paragraph in comment block or
   multiline string or selected line in a string.  All lines in the
   paragraph will be formatted to less than N columns, where N defaults to 72.

Indent Region
   Shift selected lines right by the indent width (default 4 spaces).

Dedent Region
   Shift selected lines left by the indent width (default 4 spaces).

Comment Out Region
   Insert ## in front of selected lines.

Uncomment Region
   Remove leading # or ## from selected lines.

Tabify Region
   Turn *leading* stretches of spaces into tabs. (Note: We recommend using
   4 space blocks to indent Python code.)

Untabify Region
   Turn *all* tabs into the correct number of spaces.

Toggle Tabs
   Open a dialog to switch between indenting with spaces and tabs.

New Indent Width
   Open a dialog to change indent width. The accepted default by the Python
   community is 4 spaces.

Strip Trailing Chitespace
   Remove trailing space and other whitespace characters after the last
   non-whitespace character of a line by applying str.rstrip to each line,
   including lines within multiline strings.  Except for Shell windows,
   remove extra newlines at the end of the file.

.. index::
   single: Run script

Run menu (Editor window only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _run-module:

Run Module
   Do :ref:`Check Module <check-module>`.  If no error, restart the shell to clean the
   environment, then execute the module.  Output is displayed in the Shell
   window.  Note that output requires use of ``print`` or ``write``.
   When execution is complete, the Shell retains focus and displays a prompt.
   At this point, one may interactively explore the result of execution.
   This is similar to executing a file with ``python -i file`` at a command
   line.

.. _run-custom:

Run... Customized
   Same as :ref:`Run Module <run-module>`, but run the module with customized
   settings.  *Command Line Arguments* extend :data:`sys.argv` as if passed
   on a command line. The module can be run in the Shell without restarting.

.. _check-module:

Check Module
   Check the syntax of the module currently open in the Editor window. If the
   module has not been saved IDLE will either prompt the user to save or
   autosave, as selected in the General tab of the Idle Settings dialog.  If
   there is a syntax error, the approximate location is indicated in the
   Editor window.

.. _python-shell:

Python Shell
   Open or wake up the Python Shell window.


Shell menu (Shell window only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

View Last Restart
  Scroll the shell window to the last Shell restart.

Restart Shell
  Restart the shell to clean the environment and reset display and exception handling.

Previous History
  Cycle through earlier commands in history which match the current entry.

Next History
  Cycle through later commands in history which match the current entry.

Interrupt Execution
  Stop a running program.

Debug menu (Shell window only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to File/Line
   Look on the current line. with the cursor, and the line above for a filename
   and line number.  If found, open the file if not already open, and show the
   line.  Use this to view source lines referenced in an exception traceback
   and lines found by Find in Files. Also available in the context menu of
   the Shell window and Output windows.

.. index::
   single: debugger
   single: stack viewer

Debugger (toggle)
   When activated, code entered in the Shell or run from an Editor will run
   under the debugger.  In the Editor, breakpoints can be set with the context
   menu.  This feature is still incomplete and somewhat experimental.

Stack Viewer
   Show the stack traceback of the last exception in a tree widget, with
   access to locals and globals.

Auto-open Stack Viewer
   Toggle automatically opening the stack viewer on an unhandled exception.

Options menu (Shell and Editor)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configure IDLE
   Open a configuration dialog and change preferences for the following:
   fonts, indentation, keybindings, text color themes, startup windows and
   size, additional help sources, and extensions.  On macOS, open the
   configuration dialog by selecting Preferences in the application
   menu. For more details, see
   :ref:`Setting preferences <preferences>` under Help and preferences.

Most configuration options apply to all windows or all future windows.
The option items below only apply to the active window.

Show/Hide Code Context (Editor Window only)
   Open a pane at the top of the edit window which shows the block context
   of the code which has scrolled above the top of the window.  See
   :ref:`Code Context <code-context>` in the Editing and Navigation section
   below.

Show/Hide Line Numbers (Editor Window only)
   Open a column to the left of the edit window which shows the number
   of each line of text.  The default is off, which may be changed in the
   preferences (see :ref:`Setting preferences <preferences>`).

Zoom/Restore Height
   Toggles the window between normal size and maximum height. The initial size
   defaults to 40 lines by 80 chars unless changed on the General tab of the
   Configure IDLE dialog.  The maximum height for a screen is determined by
   momentarily maximizing a window the first time one is zoomed on the screen.
   Changing screen settings may invalidate the saved height.  This toggle has
   no effect when a window is maximized.

Window menu (Shell and Editor)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lists the names of all open windows; select one to bring it to the foreground
(deiconifying it if necessary).

Help menu (Shell and Editor)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

About IDLE
   Display version, copyright, license, credits, and more.

IDLE Help
   Display this IDLE document, detailing the menu options, basic editing and
   navigation, and other tips.

Python Docs
   Access local Python documentation, if installed, or start a web browser
   and open docs.python.org showing the latest Python documentation.

Turtle Demo
   Run the turtledemo module with example Python code and turtle drawings.

Additional help sources may be added here with the Configure IDLE dialog under
the General tab. See the :ref:`Help sources <help-sources>` subsection below
for more on Help menu choices.

.. index::
   single: Cut
   single: Copy
   single: Paste
   single: Set Breakpoint
   single: Clear Breakpoint
   single: breakpoints

Context menus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a context menu by right-clicking in a window (Control-click on macOS).
Context menus have the standard clipboard functions also on the Edit menu.

Cut
   Copy selection into the system-wide clipboard; then delete the selection.

Copy
   Copy selection into the system-wide clipboard.

Paste
   Insert contents of the system-wide clipboard into the current window.

Editor windows also have breakpoint functions.  Lines with a breakpoint set are
specially marked.  Breakpoints only have an effect when running under the
debugger.  Breakpoints for a file are saved in the user's ``.idlerc``
directory.

Set Breakpoint
   Set a breakpoint on the current line.

Clear Breakpoint
   Clear the breakpoint on that line.

Shell and Output windows also have the following.

Go to file/line
   Same as in Debug menu.

The Shell window also has an output squeezing facility explained in the *Python
Shell window* subsection below.

Squeeze
   If the cursor is over an output line, squeeze all the output between
   the code above and the prompt below down to a 'Squeezed text' label.


.. _editing-and-navigation:

Editing and Navigation
----------------------

Editor windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IDLE may open editor windows when it starts, depending on settings
and how you start IDLE.  Thereafter, use the File menu.  There can be only
one open editor window for a given file.

The title bar contains the name of the file, the full path, and the version
of Python and IDLE running the window.  The status bar contains the line
number ('Ln') and column number ('Col').  Line numbers start with 1;
column numbers with 0.

IDLE assumes that files with a known .py* extension contain Python code
and that other files do not.  Run Python code with the Run menu.

Key bindings
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The IDLE insertion cursor is a thin vertical bar between character
positions.  When characters are entered, the insertion cursor and
everything to its right moves right one character and
the new character is entered in the new space.

Several non-character keys move the cursor and possibly
delete characters.  Deletion does not puts text on the clipboard,
but IDLE has an undo list.  Wherever this doc discusses keys,
'C' refers to the :kbd:`Control` key on Windows and
Unix and the :kbd:`Command` key on macOS.  (And all such discussions
assume that the keys have not been re-bound to something else.)

* Arrow keys move the cursor one character or line.

* :kbd:`C-LeftArrow` and :kbd:`C-RightArrow` moves left or right one word.

* :kbd:`Home` and :kbd:`End` go to the beginning or end of the line.

* :kbd:`Page Up` and :kbd:`Page Down` go up or down one screen.

* :kbd:`C-Home` and :kbd:`C-End` go to beginning or end of the file.

* :kbd:`Backspace` and :kbd:`Del` (or :kbd:`C-d`) delete the previous
  or next character.

* :kbd:`C-Backspace` and :kbd:`C-Del` delete one word left or right.

* :kbd:`C-k` deletes ('kills') everything to the right.

Standard keybindings (like :kbd:`C-c` to copy and :kbd:`C-v` to paste)
may work.  Keybindings are selected in the Configure IDLE dialog.

Automatic indentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After a block-opening statement, the next line is indented by 4 spaces (in the
Python Shell window by one tab).  After certain keywords (break, return etc.)
the next line is dedented.  In leading indentation, :kbd:`Backspace` deletes up
to 4 spaces if they are there. :kbd:`Tab` inserts spaces (in the Python
Shell window one tab), number depends on Indent width. Currently, tabs
are restricted to four spaces due to Tcl/Tk limitations.

See also the indent/dedent region commands on the
:ref:`Format menu <format-menu>`.

Search and Replace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any selection becomes a search target.  However, only selections within
a line work because searches are only performed within lines with the
terminal newline removed.  If ``[x] Regular expression`` is checked, the
target is interpreted according to the Python re module.

.. _completions:

Completions
^^^^^^^^^^^

Completions are supplied, when requested and available, for module
names, attributes of classes or functions, or filenames.  Each request
method displays a completion box with existing names.  (See tab
completions below for an exception.) For any box, change the name
being completed and the item highlighted in the box by
typing and deleting characters; by hitting :kbd:`Up`, :kbd:`Down`,
:kbd:`PageUp`, :kbd:`PageDown`, :kbd:`Home`, and :kbd:`End` keys;
and by a single click within the box.  Close the box with :kbd:`Escape`,
:kbd:`Enter`, and double :kbd:`Tab` keys or clicks outside the box.
A double click within the box selects and closes.

One way to open a box is to type a key character and wait for a
predefined interval.  This defaults to 2 seconds; customize it
in the settings dialog.  (To prevent auto popups, set the delay to a
large number of milliseconds, such as 100000000.) For imported module
names or class or function attributes, type '.'.
For filenames in the root directory, type :data:`os.sep` or
:data:`os.altsep` immediately after an opening quote.  (On Windows,
one can specify a drive first.)  Move into subdirectories by typing a
directory name and a separator.

Instead of waiting, or after a box is closed, open a completion box
immediately with Show Completions on the Edit menu.  The default hot
key is :kbd:`C-space`.  If one types a prefix for the desired name
before opening the box, the first match or near miss is made visible.
The result is the same as if one enters a prefix
after the box is displayed.  Show Completions after a quote completes
filenames in the current directory instead of a root directory.

Hitting :kbd:`Tab` after a prefix usually has the same effect as Show
Completions.  (With no prefix, it indents.)  However, if there is only
one match to the prefix, that match is immediately added to the editor
text without opening a box.

Invoking 'Show Completions', or hitting :kbd:`Tab` after a prefix,
outside of a string and without a preceding '.' opens a box with
keywords, builtin names, and available module-level names.

When editing code in an editor (as oppose to Shell), increase the
available module-level names by running your code
and not restarting the Shell thereafter.  This is especially useful
after adding imports at the top of a file.  This also increases
possible attribute completions.

Completion boxes initially exclude names beginning with '_' or, for
modules, not included in '__all__'.  The hidden names can be accessed
by typing '_' after '.', either before or after the box is opened.

.. _calltips:

Calltips
^^^^^^^^

A calltip is shown automatically when one types :kbd:`(` after the name
of an *accessible* function.  A function name expression may include
dots and subscripts.  A calltip remains until it is clicked, the cursor
is moved out of the argument area, or :kbd:`)` is typed.  Whenever the
cursor is in the argument part of a definition, select Edit and "Show
Call Tip" on the menu or enter its shortcut to display a calltip.

The calltip consists of the function's signature and docstring up to
the latter's first blank line or the fifth non-blank line.  (Some builtin
functions lack an accessible signature.)  A '/' or '*' in the signature
indicates that the preceding or following arguments are passed by
position or name (keyword) only.  Details are subject to change.

In Shell, the accessible functions depends on what modules have been
imported into the user process, including those imported by Idle itself,
and which definitions have been run, all since the last restart.

For example, restart the Shell and enter ``itertools.count(``.  A calltip
appears because Idle imports itertools into the user process for its own
use.  (This could change.)  Enter ``turtle.write(`` and nothing appears.
Idle does not itself import turtle.  The menu entry and shortcut also do
nothing.  Enter ``import turtle``.  Thereafter, ``turtle.write(``
will display a calltip.

In an editor, import statements have no effect until one runs the file.
One might want to run a file after writing import statements, after
adding function definitions, or after opening an existing file.

.. _code-context:

Code Context
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within an editor window containing Python code, code context can be toggled
in order to show or hide a pane at the top of the window.  When shown, this
pane freezes the opening lines for block code, such as those beginning with
``class``, ``def``, or ``if`` keywords, that would have otherwise scrolled
out of view.  The size of the pane will be expanded and contracted as needed
to show the all current levels of context, up to the maximum number of
lines defined in the Configure IDLE dialog (which defaults to 15).  If there
are no current context lines and the feature is toggled on, a single blank
line will display.  Clicking on a line in the context pane will move that
line to the top of the editor.

The text and background colors for the context pane can be configured under
the Highlights tab in the Configure IDLE dialog.

Shell window
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In IDLE's Shell, enter, edit, and recall complete statements. (Most
consoles and terminals only work with a single physical line at a time).

Submit a single-line statement for execution by hitting :kbd:`Return`
with the cursor anywhere on the line.  If a line is extended with
Backslash (:kbd:`\\`), the cursor must be on the last physical line.
Submit a multi-line compound statement by entering a blank line after
the statement.

When one pastes code into Shell, it is not compiled and possibly executed
until one hits :kbd:`Return`, as specified above.
One may edit pasted code first.
If one pastes more than one statement into Shell, the result will be a
:exc:`SyntaxError` when multiple statements are compiled as if they were one.

Lines containing ``RESTART`` mean that the user execution process has been
re-started.  This occurs when the user execution process has crashed,
when one requests a restart on the Shell menu, or when one runs code
in an editor window.

The editing features described in previous subsections work when entering
code interactively.  IDLE's Shell window also responds to the following:

* :kbd:`C-c` attempts to interrupt statement execution (but may fail).

* :kbd:`C-d` closes Shell if typed at a ``>>>`` prompt.

* :kbd:`Alt-p` and :kbd:`Alt-n` (:kbd:`C-p` and :kbd:`C-n` on macOS)
  retrieve to the current prompt the previous or next previously
  entered statement that matches anything already typed.

* :kbd:`Return` while the cursor is on any previous statement
  appends the latter to anything already typed at the prompt.

Text colors
^^^^^^^^^^^

Idle defaults to black on white text, but colors text with special meanings.
For the shell, these are shell output, shell error, user output, and
user error.  For Python code, at the shell prompt or in an editor, these are
keywords, builtin class and function names, names following ``class`` and
``def``, strings, and comments. For any text window, these are the cursor (when
present), found text (when possible), and selected text.

IDLE also highlights the :ref:`soft keywords <soft-keywords>` :keyword:`match`,
:keyword:`case <match>`, and :keyword:`_ <wildcard-patterns>` in
pattern-matching statements. However, this highlighting is not perfect and
will be incorrect in some rare cases, including some ``_``-s in ``case``
patterns.

Text coloring is done in the background, so uncolorized text is occasionally
visible.  To change the color scheme, use the Configure IDLE dialog
Highlighting tab.  The marking of debugger breakpoint lines in the editor and
text in popups and dialogs is not user-configurable.


Startup and Code Execution
--------------------------

Upon startup with the ``-s`` option, IDLE will execute the file referenced by
the environment variables :envvar:`IDLESTARTUP` or :envvar:`PYTHONSTARTUP`.
IDLE first checks for ``IDLESTARTUP``; if ``IDLESTARTUP`` is present the file
referenced is run.  If ``IDLESTARTUP`` is not present, IDLE checks for
``PYTHONSTARTUP``.  Files referenced by these environment variables are
convenient places to store functions that are used frequently from the IDLE
shell, or for executing import statements to import common modules.

In addition, ``Tk`` also loads a startup file if it is present.  Note that the
Tk file is loaded unconditionally.  This additional file is ``.Idle.py`` and is
looked for in the user's home directory.  Statements in this file will be
executed in the Tk namespace, so this file is not useful for importing
functions to be used from IDLE's Python shell.

Command line usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: none

   idle.py [-c command] [-d] [-e] [-h] [-i] [-r file] [-s] [-t title] [-] [arg] ...

   -c command  run command in the shell window
   -d          enable debugger and open shell window
   -e          open editor window
   -h          print help message with legal combinations and exit
   -i          open shell window
   -r file     run file in shell window
   -s          run $IDLESTARTUP or $PYTHONSTARTUP first, in shell window
   -t title    set title of shell window
   -           run stdin in shell (- must be last option before args)

If there are arguments:

* If ``-``, ``-c``, or ``r`` is used, all arguments are placed in
  ``sys.argv[1:...]`` and ``sys.argv[0]`` is set to ``''``, ``'-c'``,
  or ``'-r'``.  No editor window is opened, even if that is the default
  set in the Options dialog.

* Otherwise, arguments are files opened for editing and
  ``sys.argv`` reflects the arguments passed to IDLE itself.

Startup failure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IDLE uses a socket to communicate between the IDLE GUI process and the user
code execution process.  A connection must be established whenever the Shell
starts or restarts.  (The latter is indicated by a divider line that says
'RESTART'). If the user process fails to connect to the GUI process, it
usually displays a ``Tk`` error box with a 'cannot connect' message
that directs the user here.  It then exits.

One specific connection failure on Unix systems results from
misconfigured masquerading rules somewhere in a system's network setup.
When IDLE is started from a terminal, one will see a message starting
with ``** Invalid host:``.
The valid value is ``127.0.0.1 (idlelib.rpc.LOCALHOST)``.
One can diagnose with ``tcpconnect -irv 127.0.0.1 6543`` in one
terminal window and ``tcplisten <same args>`` in another.

A common cause of failure is a user-written file with the same name as a
standard library module, such as *random.py* and *tkinter.py*. When such a
file is located in the same directory as a file that is about to be run,
IDLE cannot import the stdlib file.  The current fix is to rename the
user file.

Though less common than in the past, an antivirus or firewall program may
stop the connection.  If the program cannot be taught to allow the
connection, then it must be turned off for IDLE to work.  It is safe to
allow this internal connection because no data is visible on external
ports.  A similar problem is a network mis-configuration that blocks
connections.

Python installation issues occasionally stop IDLE: multiple versions can
clash, or a single installation might need admin access.  If one undo the
clash, or cannot or does not want to run as admin, it might be easiest to
completely remove Python and start over.

A zombie pythonw.exe process could be a problem.  On Windows, use Task
Manager to check for one and stop it if there is.  Sometimes a restart
initiated by a program crash or Keyboard Interrupt (control-C) may fail
to connect.  Dismissing the error box or using Restart Shell on the Shell
menu may fix a temporary problem.

When IDLE first starts, it attempts to read user configuration files in
``~/.idlerc/`` (~ is one's home directory).  If there is a problem, an error
message should be displayed.  Leaving aside random disk glitches, this can
be prevented by never editing the files by hand.  Instead, use the
configuration dialog, under Options.  Once there is an error in a user
configuration file, the best solution may be to delete it and start over
with the settings dialog.

If IDLE quits with no message, and it was not started from a console, try
starting it from a console or terminal (``python -m idlelib``) and see if
this results in an error message.

On Unix-based systems with tcl/tk older than ``8.6.11`` (see
``About IDLE``) certain characters of certain fonts can cause
a tk failure with a message to the terminal.  This can happen either
if one starts IDLE to edit a file with such a character or later
when entering such a character.  If one cannot upgrade tcl/tk,
then re-configure IDLE to use a font that works better.

Running user code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With rare exceptions, the result of executing Python code with IDLE is
intended to be the same as executing the same code by the default method,
directly with Python in a text-mode system console or terminal window.
However, the different interface and operation occasionally affect
visible results.  For instance, ``sys.modules`` starts with more entries,
and ``threading.active_count()`` returns 2 instead of 1.

By default, IDLE runs user code in a separate OS process rather than in
the user interface process that runs the shell and editor.  In the execution
process, it replaces ``sys.stdin``, ``sys.stdout``, and ``sys.stderr``
with objects that get input from and send output to the Shell window.
The original values stored in ``sys.__stdin__``, ``sys.__stdout__``, and
``sys.__stderr__`` are not touched, but may be ``None``.

Sending print output from one process to a text widget in another is
slower than printing to a system terminal in the same process.
This has the most effect when printing multiple arguments, as the string
for each argument, each separator, the newline are sent separately.
For development, this is usually not a problem, but if one wants to
print faster in IDLE, format and join together everything one wants
displayed together and then print a single string.  Both format strings
and :meth:`str.join` can help combine fields and lines.

IDLE's standard stream replacements are not inherited by subprocesses
created in the execution process, whether directly by user code or by
modules such as multiprocessing.  If such subprocess use ``input`` from
sys.stdin or ``print`` or ``write`` to sys.stdout or sys.stderr,
IDLE should be started in a command line window.  (On Windows,
use ``python`` or ``py`` rather than ``pythonw`` or ``pyw``.)
The secondary subprocess
will then be attached to that window for input and output.

If ``sys`` is reset by user code, such as with ``importlib.reload(sys)``,
IDLE's changes are lost and input from the keyboard and output to the screen
will not work correctly.

When Shell has the focus, it controls the keyboard and screen.  This is
normally transparent, but functions that directly access the keyboard
and screen will not work.  These include system-specific functions that
determine whether a key has been pressed and if so, which.

The IDLE code running in the execution process adds frames to the call stack
that would not be there otherwise.  IDLE wraps ``sys.getrecursionlimit`` and
``sys.setrecursionlimit`` to reduce the effect of the additional stack
frames.

When user code raises SystemExit either directly or by calling sys.exit,
IDLE returns to a Shell prompt instead of exiting.

User output in Shell
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a program outputs text, the result is determined by the
corresponding output device.  When IDLE executes user code, ``sys.stdout``
and ``sys.stderr`` are connected to the display area of IDLE's Shell.  Some of
its features are inherited from the underlying Tk Text widget.  Others
are programmed additions.  Where it matters, Shell is designed for development
rather than production runs.

For instance, Shell never throws away output.  A program that sends unlimited
output to Shell will eventually fill memory, resulting in a memory error.
In contrast, some system text windows only keep the last n lines of output.
A Windows console, for instance, keeps a user-settable 1 to 9999 lines,
with 300 the default.

A Tk Text widget, and hence IDLE's Shell, displays characters (codepoints) in
the BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane) subset of Unicode.  Which characters are
displayed with a proper glyph and which with a replacement box depends on the
operating system and installed fonts.  Tab characters cause the following text
to begin after the next tab stop. (They occur every 8 'characters').  Newline
characters cause following text to appear on a new line.  Other control
characters are ignored or displayed as a space, box, or something else,
depending on the operating system and font.  (Moving the text cursor through
such output with arrow keys may exhibit some surprising spacing behavior.) ::

   >>> s = 'a\tb\a<\x02><\r>\bc\nd'  # Enter 22 chars.
   >>> len(s)
   14
   >>> s  # Display repr(s)
   'a\tb\x07<\x02><\r>\x08c\nd'
   >>> print(s, end='')  # Display s as is.
   # Result varies by OS and font.  Try it.

The ``repr`` function is used for interactive echo of expression
values.  It returns an altered version of the input string in which
control codes, some BMP codepoints, and all non-BMP codepoints are
replaced with escape codes. As demonstrated above, it allows one to
identify the characters in a string, regardless of how they are displayed.

Normal and error output are generally kept separate (on separate lines)
from code input and each other.  They each get different highlight colors.

For SyntaxError tracebacks, the normal '^' marking where the error was
detected is replaced by coloring the text with an error highlight.
When code run from a file causes other exceptions, one may right click
on a traceback line to jump to the corresponding line in an IDLE editor.
The file will be opened if necessary.

Shell has a special facility for squeezing output lines down to a
'Squeezed text' label.  This is done automatically
for output over N lines (N = 50 by default).
N can be changed in the PyShell section of the General
page of the Settings dialog.  Output with fewer lines can be squeezed by
right clicking on the output.  This can be useful lines long enough to slow
down scrolling.

Squeezed output is expanded in place by double-clicking the label.
It can also be sent to the clipboard or a separate view window by
right-clicking the label.

Developing tkinter applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IDLE is intentionally different from standard Python in order to
facilitate development of tkinter programs.  Enter ``import tkinter as tk;
root = tk.Tk()`` in standard Python and nothing appears.  Enter the same
in IDLE and a tk window appears.  In standard Python, one must also enter
``root.update()`` to see the window.  IDLE does the equivalent in the
background, about 20 times a second, which is about every 50 milliseconds.
Next enter ``b = tk.Button(root, text='button'); b.pack()``.  Again,
nothing visibly changes in standard Python until one enters ``root.update()``.

Most tkinter programs run ``root.mainloop()``, which usually does not
return until the tk app is destroyed.  If the program is run with
``python -i`` or from an IDLE editor, a ``>>>`` shell prompt does not
appear until ``mainloop()`` returns, at which time there is nothing left
to interact with.

When running a tkinter program from an IDLE editor, one can comment out
the mainloop call.  One then gets a shell prompt immediately and can
interact with the live application.  One just has to remember to
re-enable the mainloop call when running in standard Python.

Running without a subprocess
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, IDLE executes user code in a separate subprocess via a socket,
which uses the internal loopback interface.  This connection is not
externally visible and no data is sent to or received from the internet.
If firewall software complains anyway, you can ignore it.

If the attempt to make the socket connection fails, Idle will notify you.
Such failures are sometimes transient, but if persistent, the problem
may be either a firewall blocking the connection or misconfiguration of
a particular system.  Until the problem is fixed, one can run Idle with
the -n command line switch.

If IDLE is started with the -n command line switch it will run in a
single process and will not create the subprocess which runs the RPC
Python execution server.  This can be useful if Python cannot create
the subprocess or the RPC socket interface on your platform.  However,
in this mode user code is not isolated from IDLE itself.  Also, the
environment is not restarted when Run/Run Module (F5) is selected.  If
your code has been modified, you must reload() the affected modules and
re-import any specific items (e.g. from foo import baz) if the changes
are to take effect.  For these reasons, it is preferable to run IDLE
with the default subprocess if at all possible.

.. deprecated:: 3.4


Help and Preferences
--------------------

.. _help-sources:

Help sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Help menu entry "IDLE Help" displays a formatted html version of the
IDLE chapter of the Library Reference.  The result, in a read-only
tkinter text window, is close to what one sees in a web browser.
Navigate through the text with a mousewheel,
the scrollbar, or up and down arrow keys held down.
Or click the TOC (Table of Contents) button and select a section
header in the opened box.

Help menu entry "Python Docs" opens the extensive sources of help,
including tutorials, available at ``docs.python.org/x.y``, where 'x.y'
is the currently running Python version.  If your system
has an off-line copy of the docs (this may be an installation option),
that will be opened instead.

Selected URLs can be added or removed from the help menu at any time using the
General tab of the Configure IDLE dialog.

.. _preferences:

Setting preferences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The font preferences, highlighting, keys, and general preferences can be
changed via Configure IDLE on the Option menu.
Non-default user settings are saved in a ``.idlerc`` directory in the user's
home directory.  Problems caused by bad user configuration files are solved
by editing or deleting one or more of the files in ``.idlerc``.

On the Font tab, see the text sample for the effect of font face and size
on multiple characters in multiple languages.  Edit the sample to add
other characters of personal interest.  Use the sample to select
monospaced fonts.  If particular characters have problems in Shell or an
editor, add them to the top of the sample and try changing first size
and then font.

On the Highlights and Keys tab, select a built-in or custom color theme
and key set.  To use a newer built-in color theme or key set with older
IDLEs, save it as a new custom theme or key set and it well be accessible
to older IDLEs.

IDLE on macOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under System Preferences: Dock, one can set "Prefer tabs when opening
documents" to "Always".  This setting is not compatible with the tk/tkinter
GUI framework used by IDLE, and it breaks a few IDLE features.

Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^

IDLE contains an extension facility.  Preferences for extensions can be
changed with the Extensions tab of the preferences dialog. See the
beginning of config-extensions.def in the idlelib directory for further
information.  The only current default extension is zzdummy, an example
also used for testing.


idlelib
-------

.. module:: idlelib
   :synopsis: Implementation package for the IDLE shell/editor.

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/idlelib`

--------------

The Lib/idlelib package implements the IDLE application.  See the rest
of this page for how to use IDLE.

The files in idlelib are described in idlelib/README.txt.  Access it
either in idlelib or click Help => About IDLE on the IDLE menu.  This
file also maps IDLE menu items to the code that implements the item.
Except for files listed under 'Startup', the idlelib code is 'private' in
sense that feature changes can be backported (see :pep:`434`).

:mod:`!imaplib` --- IMAP4 protocol client
=========================================

.. module:: imaplib
   :synopsis: IMAP4 protocol client (requires sockets).

.. moduleauthor:: Piers Lauder <piers@communitysolutions.com.au>
.. sectionauthor:: Piers Lauder <piers@communitysolutions.com.au>
.. revised by ESR, January 2000
.. changes for IMAP4_SSL by Tino Lange <Tino.Lange@isg.de>, March 2002
.. changes for IMAP4_stream by Piers Lauder <piers@communitysolutions.com.au>,
   November 2002

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/imaplib.py`

.. index::
   pair: IMAP4; protocol
   pair: IMAP4_SSL; protocol
   pair: IMAP4_stream; protocol

--------------

This module defines three classes, :class:`IMAP4`, :class:`IMAP4_SSL` and
:class:`IMAP4_stream`, which encapsulate a connection to an IMAP4 server and
implement a large subset of the IMAP4rev1 client protocol as defined in
:rfc:`2060`. It is backward compatible with IMAP4 (:rfc:`1730`) servers, but
note that the ``STATUS`` command is not supported in IMAP4.

.. include:: ../includes/wasm-notavail.rst

Three classes are provided by the :mod:`imaplib` module, :class:`IMAP4` is the
base class:


.. class:: IMAP4(host='', port=IMAP4_PORT, timeout=None)

   This class implements the actual IMAP4 protocol.  The connection is created and
   protocol version (IMAP4 or IMAP4rev1) is determined when the instance is
   initialized. If *host* is not specified, ``''`` (the local host) is used. If
   *port* is omitted, the standard IMAP4 port (143) is used. The optional *timeout*
   parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for the connection attempt.
   If timeout is not given or is ``None``, the global default socket timeout is used.

   The :class:`IMAP4` class supports the :keyword:`with` statement.  When used
   like this, the IMAP4 ``LOGOUT`` command is issued automatically when the
   :keyword:`!with` statement exits.  E.g.::

    >>> from imaplib import IMAP4
    >>> with IMAP4("domain.org") as M:
    ...     M.noop()
    ...
    ('OK', [b'Nothing Accomplished. d25if65hy903weo.87'])

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Support for the :keyword:`with` statement was added.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.9
      The optional *timeout* parameter was added.

Three exceptions are defined as attributes of the :class:`IMAP4` class:


.. exception:: IMAP4.error

   Exception raised on any errors.  The reason for the exception is passed to the
   constructor as a string.


.. exception:: IMAP4.abort

   IMAP4 server errors cause this exception to be raised.  This is a sub-class of
   :exc:`IMAP4.error`.  Note that closing the instance and instantiating a new one
   will usually allow recovery from this exception.


.. exception:: IMAP4.readonly

   This exception is raised when a writable mailbox has its status changed by the
   server.  This is a sub-class of :exc:`IMAP4.error`.  Some other client now has
   write permission, and the mailbox will need to be re-opened to re-obtain write
   permission.


There's also a subclass for secure connections:


.. class:: IMAP4_SSL(host='', port=IMAP4_SSL_PORT, *, ssl_context=None, \
                     timeout=None)

   This is a subclass derived from :class:`IMAP4` that connects over an SSL
   encrypted socket (to use this class you need a socket module that was compiled
   with SSL support).  If *host* is not specified, ``''`` (the local host) is used.
   If *port* is omitted, the standard IMAP4-over-SSL port (993) is used.
   *ssl_context* is a :class:`ssl.SSLContext` object which allows bundling
   SSL configuration options, certificates and private keys into a single
   (potentially long-lived) structure.  Please read :ref:`ssl-security` for
   best practices.

   The optional *timeout* parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for the
   connection attempt. If timeout is not given or is ``None``, the global default
   socket timeout is used.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      *ssl_context* parameter was added.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      The class now supports hostname check with
      :attr:`ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname` and *Server Name Indication* (see
      :const:`ssl.HAS_SNI`).

   .. versionchanged:: 3.9
      The optional *timeout* parameter was added.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.12
      The deprecated *keyfile* and *certfile* parameters have been removed.

The second subclass allows for connections created by a child process:


.. class:: IMAP4_stream(command)

   This is a subclass derived from :class:`IMAP4` that connects to the
   ``stdin/stdout`` file descriptors created by passing *command* to
   ``subprocess.Popen()``.


The following utility functions are defined:


.. function:: Internaldate2tuple(datestr)

   Parse an IMAP4 ``INTERNALDATE`` string and return corresponding local
   time.  The return value is a :class:`time.struct_time` tuple or
   ``None`` if the string has wrong format.

.. function:: Int2AP(num)

   Converts an integer into a bytes representation using characters from the set
   [``A`` .. ``P``].


.. function:: ParseFlags(flagstr)

   Converts an IMAP4 ``FLAGS`` response to a tuple of individual flags.


.. function:: Time2Internaldate(date_time)

   Convert *date_time* to an IMAP4 ``INTERNALDATE`` representation.
   The return value is a string in the form: ``"DD-Mmm-YYYY HH:MM:SS
   +HHMM"`` (including double-quotes).  The *date_time* argument can
   be a number (int or float) representing seconds since epoch (as
   returned by :func:`time.time`), a 9-tuple representing local time
   an instance of :class:`time.struct_time` (as returned by
   :func:`time.localtime`), an aware instance of
   :class:`datetime.datetime`, or a double-quoted string.  In the last
   case, it is assumed to already be in the correct format.

Note that IMAP4 message numbers change as the mailbox changes; in particular,
after an ``EXPUNGE`` command performs deletions the remaining messages are
renumbered. So it is highly advisable to use UIDs instead, with the UID command.

At the end of the module, there is a test section that contains a more extensive
example of usage.


.. seealso::

   Documents describing the protocol, sources for servers
   implementing it, by the University of Washington's IMAP Information Center
   can all be found at (**Source Code**) https://github.com/uw-imap/imap (**Not Maintained**).


.. _imap4-objects:

IMAP4 Objects
-------------

All IMAP4rev1 commands are represented by methods of the same name, either
uppercase or lowercase.

All arguments to commands are converted to strings, except for ``AUTHENTICATE``,
and the last argument to ``APPEND`` which is passed as an IMAP4 literal.  If
necessary (the string contains IMAP4 protocol-sensitive characters and isn't
enclosed with either parentheses or double quotes) each string is quoted.
However, the *password* argument to the ``LOGIN`` command is always quoted. If
you want to avoid having an argument string quoted (eg: the *flags* argument to
``STORE``) then enclose the string in parentheses (eg: ``r'(\Deleted)'``).

Each command returns a tuple: ``(type, [data, ...])`` where *type* is usually
``'OK'`` or ``'NO'``, and *data* is either the text from the command response,
or mandated results from the command. Each *data* is either a ``bytes``, or a
tuple. If a tuple, then the first part is the header of the response, and the
second part contains the data (ie: 'literal' value).

The *message_set* options to commands below is a string specifying one or more
messages to be acted upon.  It may be a simple message number (``'1'``), a range
of message numbers (``'2:4'``), or a group of non-contiguous ranges separated by
commas (``'1:3,6:9'``).  A range can contain an asterisk to indicate an infinite
upper bound (``'3:*'``).

An :class:`IMAP4` instance has the following methods:


.. method:: IMAP4.append(mailbox, flags, date_time, message)

   Append *message* to named mailbox.


.. method:: IMAP4.authenticate(mechanism, authobject)

   Authenticate command --- requires response processing.

   *mechanism* specifies which authentication mechanism is to be used - it should
   appear in the instance variable ``capabilities`` in the form ``AUTH=mechanism``.

   *authobject* must be a callable object::

      data = authobject(response)

   It will be called to process server continuation responses; the *response*
   argument it is passed will be ``bytes``.  It should return ``bytes`` *data*
   that will be base64 encoded and sent to the server.  It should return
   ``None`` if the client abort response ``*`` should be sent instead.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      string usernames and passwords are now encoded to ``utf-8`` instead of
      being limited to ASCII.


.. method:: IMAP4.check()

   Checkpoint mailbox on server.


.. method:: IMAP4.close()

   Close currently selected mailbox. Deleted messages are removed from writable
   mailbox. This is the recommended command before ``LOGOUT``.


.. method:: IMAP4.copy(message_set, new_mailbox)

   Copy *message_set* messages onto end of *new_mailbox*.


.. method:: IMAP4.create(mailbox)

   Create new mailbox named *mailbox*.


.. method:: IMAP4.delete(mailbox)

   Delete old mailbox named *mailbox*.


.. method:: IMAP4.deleteacl(mailbox, who)

   Delete the ACLs (remove any rights) set for who on mailbox.


.. method:: IMAP4.enable(capability)

   Enable *capability* (see :rfc:`5161`).  Most capabilities do not need to be
   enabled.  Currently only the ``UTF8=ACCEPT`` capability is supported
   (see :RFC:`6855`).

   .. versionadded:: 3.5
      The :meth:`enable` method itself, and :RFC:`6855` support.


.. method:: IMAP4.expunge()

   Permanently remove deleted items from selected mailbox. Generates an ``EXPUNGE``
   response for each deleted message. Returned data contains a list of ``EXPUNGE``
   message numbers in order received.


.. method:: IMAP4.fetch(message_set, message_parts)

   Fetch (parts of) messages.  *message_parts* should be a string of message part
   names enclosed within parentheses, eg: ``"(UID BODY[TEXT])"``.  Returned data
   are tuples of message part envelope and data.


.. method:: IMAP4.getacl(mailbox)

   Get the ``ACL``\ s for *mailbox*. The method is non-standard, but is supported
   by the ``Cyrus`` server.


.. method:: IMAP4.getannotation(mailbox, entry, attribute)

   Retrieve the specified ``ANNOTATION``\ s for *mailbox*. The method is
   non-standard, but is supported by the ``Cyrus`` server.


.. method:: IMAP4.getquota(root)

   Get the ``quota`` *root*'s resource usage and limits. This method is part of the
   IMAP4 QUOTA extension defined in rfc2087.


.. method:: IMAP4.getquotaroot(mailbox)

   Get the list of ``quota`` ``roots`` for the named *mailbox*. This method is part
   of the IMAP4 QUOTA extension defined in rfc2087.


.. method:: IMAP4.list([directory[, pattern]])

   List mailbox names in *directory* matching *pattern*.  *directory* defaults to
   the top-level mail folder, and *pattern* defaults to match anything.  Returned
   data contains a list of ``LIST`` responses.


.. method:: IMAP4.login(user, password)

   Identify the client using a plaintext password. The *password* will be quoted.


.. method:: IMAP4.login_cram_md5(user, password)

   Force use of ``CRAM-MD5`` authentication when identifying the client to protect
   the password.  Will only work if the server ``CAPABILITY`` response includes the
   phrase ``AUTH=CRAM-MD5``.


.. method:: IMAP4.logout()

   Shutdown connection to server. Returns server ``BYE`` response.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.8
      The method no longer ignores silently arbitrary exceptions.


.. method:: IMAP4.lsub(directory='""', pattern='*')

   List subscribed mailbox names in directory matching pattern. *directory*
   defaults to the top level directory and *pattern* defaults to match any mailbox.
   Returned data are tuples of message part envelope and data.


.. method:: IMAP4.myrights(mailbox)

   Show my ACLs for a mailbox (i.e. the rights that I have on mailbox).


.. method:: IMAP4.namespace()

   Returns IMAP namespaces as defined in :rfc:`2342`.


.. method:: IMAP4.noop()

   Send ``NOOP`` to server.


.. method:: IMAP4.open(host, port, timeout=None)

   Opens socket to *port* at *host*. The optional *timeout* parameter
   specifies a timeout in seconds for the connection attempt.
   If timeout is not given or is ``None``, the global default socket timeout
   is used. Also note that if the *timeout* parameter is set to be zero,
   it will raise a :class:`ValueError` to reject creating a non-blocking socket.
   This method is implicitly called by the :class:`IMAP4` constructor.
   The connection objects established by this method will be used in
   the :meth:`IMAP4.read`, :meth:`IMAP4.readline`, :meth:`IMAP4.send`,
   and :meth:`IMAP4.shutdown` methods. You may override this method.

   .. audit-event:: imaplib.open self,host,port imaplib.IMAP4.open

   .. versionchanged:: 3.9
      The *timeout* parameter was added.

.. method:: IMAP4.partial(message_num, message_part, start, length)

   Fetch truncated part of a message. Returned data is a tuple of message part
   envelope and data.


.. method:: IMAP4.proxyauth(user)

   Assume authentication as *user*. Allows an authorised administrator to proxy
   into any user's mailbox.


.. method:: IMAP4.read(size)

   Reads *size* bytes from the remote server. You may override this method.


.. method:: IMAP4.readline()

   Reads one line from the remote server. You may override this method.


.. method:: IMAP4.recent()

   Prompt server for an update. Returned data is ``None`` if no new messages, else
   value of ``RECENT`` response.


.. method:: IMAP4.rename(oldmailbox, newmailbox)

   Rename mailbox named *oldmailbox* to *newmailbox*.


.. method:: IMAP4.response(code)

   Return data for response *code* if received, or ``None``. Returns the given
   code, instead of the usual type.


.. method:: IMAP4.search(charset, criterion[, ...])

   Search mailbox for matching messages.  *charset* may be ``None``, in which case
   no ``CHARSET`` will be specified in the request to the server.  The IMAP
   protocol requires that at least one criterion be specified; an exception will be
   raised when the server returns an error.  *charset* must be ``None`` if
   the ``UTF8=ACCEPT`` capability was enabled using the :meth:`enable`
   command.

   Example::

      # M is a connected IMAP4 instance...
      typ, msgnums = M.search(None, 'FROM', '"LDJ"')

      # or:
      typ, msgnums = M.search(None, '(FROM "LDJ")')


.. method:: IMAP4.select(mailbox='INBOX', readonly=False)

   Select a mailbox. Returned data is the count of messages in *mailbox*
   (``EXISTS`` response).  The default *mailbox* is ``'INBOX'``.  If the *readonly*
   flag is set, modifications to the mailbox are not allowed.


.. method:: IMAP4.send(data)

   Sends ``data`` to the remote server. You may override this method.

   .. audit-event:: imaplib.send self,data imaplib.IMAP4.send


.. method:: IMAP4.setacl(mailbox, who, what)

   Set an ``ACL`` for *mailbox*. The method is non-standard, but is supported by
   the ``Cyrus`` server.


.. method:: IMAP4.setannotation(mailbox, entry, attribute[, ...])

   Set ``ANNOTATION``\ s for *mailbox*. The method is non-standard, but is
   supported by the ``Cyrus`` server.


.. method:: IMAP4.setquota(root, limits)

   Set the ``quota`` *root*'s resource *limits*. This method is part of the IMAP4
   QUOTA extension defined in rfc2087.


.. method:: IMAP4.shutdown()

   Close connection established in ``open``.  This method is implicitly
   called by :meth:`IMAP4.logout`.  You may override this method.


.. method:: IMAP4.socket()

   Returns socket instance used to connect to server.


.. method:: IMAP4.sort(sort_criteria, charset, search_criterion[, ...])

   The ``sort`` command is a variant of ``search`` with sorting semantics for the
   results.  Returned data contains a space separated list of matching message
   numbers.

   Sort has two arguments before the *search_criterion* argument(s); a
   parenthesized list of *sort_criteria*, and the searching *charset*.  Note that
   unlike ``search``, the searching *charset* argument is mandatory.  There is also
   a ``uid sort`` command which corresponds to ``sort`` the way that ``uid search``
   corresponds to ``search``.  The ``sort`` command first searches the mailbox for
   messages that match the given searching criteria using the charset argument for
   the interpretation of strings in the searching criteria.  It then returns the
   numbers of matching messages.

   This is an ``IMAP4rev1`` extension command.


.. method:: IMAP4.starttls(ssl_context=None)

   Send a ``STARTTLS`` command.  The *ssl_context* argument is optional
   and should be a :class:`ssl.SSLContext` object.  This will enable
   encryption on the IMAP connection.  Please read :ref:`ssl-security` for
   best practices.

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      The method now supports hostname check with
      :attr:`ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname` and *Server Name Indication* (see
      :const:`ssl.HAS_SNI`).


.. method:: IMAP4.status(mailbox, names)

   Request named status conditions for *mailbox*.


.. method:: IMAP4.store(message_set, command, flag_list)

   Alters flag dispositions for messages in mailbox.  *command* is specified by
   section 6.4.6 of :rfc:`2060` as being one of "FLAGS", "+FLAGS", or "-FLAGS",
   optionally with a suffix of ".SILENT".

   For example, to set the delete flag on all messages::

      typ, data = M.search(None, 'ALL')
      for num in data[0].split():
         M.store(num, '+FLAGS', '\\Deleted')
      M.expunge()

   .. note::

      Creating flags containing ']' (for example: "[test]") violates
      :rfc:`3501` (the IMAP protocol).  However, imaplib has historically
      allowed creation of such tags, and popular IMAP servers, such as Gmail,
      accept and produce such flags.  There are non-Python programs which also
      create such tags.  Although it is an RFC violation and IMAP clients and
      servers are supposed to be strict, imaplib still continues to allow
      such tags to be created for backward compatibility reasons, and as of
      Python 3.6, handles them if they are sent from the server, since this
      improves real-world compatibility.

.. method:: IMAP4.subscribe(mailbox)

   Subscribe to new mailbox.


.. method:: IMAP4.thread(threading_algorithm, charset, search_criterion[, ...])

   The ``thread`` command is a variant of ``search`` with threading semantics for
   the results.  Returned data contains a space separated list of thread members.

   Thread members consist of zero or more messages numbers, delimited by spaces,
   indicating successive parent and child.

   Thread has two arguments before the *search_criterion* argument(s); a
   *threading_algorithm*, and the searching *charset*.  Note that unlike
   ``search``, the searching *charset* argument is mandatory.  There is also a
   ``uid thread`` command which corresponds to ``thread`` the way that ``uid
   search`` corresponds to ``search``.  The ``thread`` command first searches the
   mailbox for messages that match the given searching criteria using the *charset*
   argument for the interpretation of strings in the searching criteria. It then
   returns the matching messages threaded according to the specified threading
   algorithm.

   This is an ``IMAP4rev1`` extension command.


.. method:: IMAP4.uid(command, arg[, ...])

   Execute command args with messages identified by UID, rather than message
   number.  Returns response appropriate to command.  At least one argument must be
   supplied; if none are provided, the server will return an error and an exception
   will be raised.


.. method:: IMAP4.unsubscribe(mailbox)

   Unsubscribe from old mailbox.

.. method:: IMAP4.unselect()

   :meth:`imaplib.IMAP4.unselect` frees server's resources associated with the
   selected mailbox and returns the server to the authenticated
   state. This command performs the same actions as :meth:`imaplib.IMAP4.close`, except
   that no messages are permanently removed from the currently
   selected mailbox.

   .. versionadded:: 3.9

.. method:: IMAP4.xatom(name[, ...])

   Allow simple extension commands notified by server in ``CAPABILITY`` response.


The following attributes are defined on instances of :class:`IMAP4`:

.. attribute:: IMAP4.PROTOCOL_VERSION

   The most recent supported protocol in the ``CAPABILITY`` response from the
   server.


.. attribute:: IMAP4.debug

   Integer value to control debugging output.  The initialize value is taken from
   the module variable ``Debug``.  Values greater than three trace each command.


.. attribute:: IMAP4.utf8_enabled

   Boolean value that is normally ``False``, but is set to ``True`` if an
   :meth:`enable` command is successfully issued for the ``UTF8=ACCEPT``
   capability.

   .. versionadded:: 3.5


.. _imap4-example:

IMAP4 Example
-------------

Here is a minimal example (without error checking) that opens a mailbox and
retrieves and prints all messages::

   import getpass, imaplib

   M = imaplib.IMAP4(host='example.org')
   M.login(getpass.getuser(), getpass.getpass())
   M.select()
   typ, data = M.search(None, 'ALL')
   for num in data[0].split():
       typ, data = M.fetch(num, '(RFC822)')
       print('Message %s\n%s\n' % (num, data[0][1]))
   M.close()
   M.logout()

:mod:`!importlib.metadata` -- Accessing package metadata
========================================================

.. module:: importlib.metadata
   :synopsis: Accessing package metadata

.. versionadded:: 3.8
.. versionchanged:: 3.10
   ``importlib.metadata`` is no longer provisional.

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/importlib/metadata/__init__.py`

``importlib.metadata`` is a library that provides access to
the metadata of an installed `Distribution Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_,
such as its entry points
or its top-level names (`Import Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Import-Package>`_\s, modules, if any).
Built in part on Python's import system, this library
intends to replace similar functionality in the `entry point
API`_ and `metadata API`_ of ``pkg_resources``. Along with
:mod:`importlib.resources`,
this package can eliminate the need to use the older and less efficient
``pkg_resources`` package.

``importlib.metadata`` operates on third-party *distribution packages*
installed into Python's ``site-packages`` directory via tools such as
:pypi:`pip`.
Specifically, it works with distributions with discoverable
``dist-info`` or ``egg-info`` directories,
and metadata defined by the `Core metadata specifications <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#core-metadata>`_.

.. important::

   These are *not* necessarily equivalent to or correspond 1:1 with
   the top-level *import package* names
   that can be imported inside Python code.
   One *distribution package* can contain multiple *import packages*
   (and single modules),
   and one top-level *import package*
   may map to multiple *distribution packages*
   if it is a namespace package.
   You can use :ref:`packages_distributions() <package-distributions>`
   to get a mapping between them.

By default, distribution metadata can live on the file system
or in zip archives on
:data:`sys.path`. Through an extension mechanism, the metadata can live almost
anywhere.


.. seealso::

   https://importlib-metadata.readthedocs.io/
      The documentation for ``importlib_metadata``, which supplies a
      backport of ``importlib.metadata``.
      This includes an `API reference
      <https://importlib-metadata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`__
      for this module's classes and functions,
      as well as a `migration guide
      <https://importlib-metadata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration.html>`__
      for existing users of ``pkg_resources``.


Overview
========

Let's say you wanted to get the version string for a
`Distribution Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_ you've installed
using ``pip``. We start by creating a virtual environment and installing
something into it:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ python -m venv example
    $ source example/bin/activate
    (example) $ python -m pip install wheel

You can get the version string for ``wheel`` by running the following:

.. code-block:: pycon

    (example) $ python
    >>> from importlib.metadata import version  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> version('wheel')  # doctest: +SKIP
    '0.32.3'

You can also get a collection of entry points selectable by properties of the EntryPoint (typically 'group' or 'name'), such as
``console_scripts``, ``distutils.commands`` and others. Each group contains a
collection of :ref:`EntryPoint <entry-points>` objects.

You can get the :ref:`metadata for a distribution <metadata>`::

    >>> list(metadata('wheel'))  # doctest: +SKIP
    ['Metadata-Version', 'Name', 'Version', 'Summary', 'Home-page', 'Author', 'Author-email', 'Maintainer', 'Maintainer-email', 'License', 'Project-URL', 'Project-URL', 'Project-URL', 'Keywords', 'Platform', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Requires-Python', 'Provides-Extra', 'Requires-Dist', 'Requires-Dist']

You can also get a :ref:`distribution's version number <version>`, list its
:ref:`constituent files <files>`, and get a list of the distribution's
:ref:`requirements`.


.. exception:: PackageNotFoundError

   Subclass of :class:`ModuleNotFoundError` raised by several functions in this
   module when queried for a distribution package which is not installed in the
   current Python environment.


Functional API
==============

This package provides the following functionality via its public API.


.. _entry-points:

Entry points
------------

.. function:: entry_points(**select_params)

   Returns a :class:`EntryPoints` instance describing entry points for the
   current environment. Any given keyword parameters are passed to the
   :meth:`!select` method for comparison to the attributes of
   the individual entry point definitions.

   Note: it is not currently possible to query for entry points based on
   their :attr:`!EntryPoint.dist` attribute (as different :class:`!Distribution`
   instances do not currently compare equal, even if they have the same attributes)

.. class:: EntryPoints

   Details of a collection of installed entry points.

   Also provides a ``.groups`` attribute that reports all identified entry
   point groups, and a ``.names`` attribute that reports all identified entry
   point names.

.. class:: EntryPoint

   Details of an installed entry point.

   Each :class:`!EntryPoint` instance has ``.name``, ``.group``, and ``.value``
   attributes and a ``.load()`` method to resolve the value. There are also
   ``.module``, ``.attr``, and ``.extras`` attributes for getting the
   components of the ``.value`` attribute, and ``.dist`` for obtaining
   information regarding the distribution package that provides the entry point.

Query all entry points::

    >>> eps = entry_points()  # doctest: +SKIP

The :func:`!entry_points` function returns a :class:`!EntryPoints` object,
a collection of all :class:`!EntryPoint` objects with ``names`` and ``groups``
attributes for convenience::

    >>> sorted(eps.groups)  # doctest: +SKIP
    ['console_scripts', 'distutils.commands', 'distutils.setup_keywords', 'egg_info.writers', 'setuptools.installation']

:class:`!EntryPoints` has a :meth:`!select` method to select entry points
matching specific properties. Select entry points in the
``console_scripts`` group::

    >>> scripts = eps.select(group='console_scripts')  # doctest: +SKIP

Equivalently, since :func:`!entry_points` passes keyword arguments
through to select::

    >>> scripts = entry_points(group='console_scripts')  # doctest: +SKIP

Pick out a specific script named "wheel" (found in the wheel project)::

    >>> 'wheel' in scripts.names  # doctest: +SKIP
    True
    >>> wheel = scripts['wheel']  # doctest: +SKIP

Equivalently, query for that entry point during selection::

    >>> (wheel,) = entry_points(group='console_scripts', name='wheel')  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> (wheel,) = entry_points().select(group='console_scripts', name='wheel')  # doctest: +SKIP

Inspect the resolved entry point::

    >>> wheel  # doctest: +SKIP
    EntryPoint(name='wheel', value='wheel.cli:main', group='console_scripts')
    >>> wheel.module  # doctest: +SKIP
    'wheel.cli'
    >>> wheel.attr  # doctest: +SKIP
    'main'
    >>> wheel.extras  # doctest: +SKIP
    []
    >>> main = wheel.load()  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> main  # doctest: +SKIP
    <function main at 0x103528488>

The ``group`` and ``name`` are arbitrary values defined by the package author
and usually a client will wish to resolve all entry points for a particular
group. Read `the setuptools docs
<https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html>`_
for more information on entry points, their definition, and usage.

.. versionchanged:: 3.12
   The "selectable" entry points were introduced in ``importlib_metadata``
   3.6 and Python 3.10. Prior to those changes, ``entry_points`` accepted
   no parameters and always returned a dictionary of entry points, keyed
   by group. With ``importlib_metadata`` 5.0 and Python 3.12,
   ``entry_points`` always returns an ``EntryPoints`` object. See
   :pypi:`backports.entry_points_selectable`
   for compatibility options.

.. versionchanged:: 3.13
   ``EntryPoint`` objects no longer present a tuple-like interface
   (:meth:`~object.__getitem__`).

.. _metadata:

Distribution metadata
---------------------

.. function:: metadata(distribution_name)

   Return the distribution metadata corresponding to the named
   distribution package as a :class:`PackageMetadata` instance.

   Raises :exc:`PackageNotFoundError` if the named distribution
   package is not installed in the current Python environment.

.. class:: PackageMetadata

   A concrete implementation of the
   `PackageMetadata protocol <https://importlib-metadata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#importlib_metadata.PackageMetadata>`_.

   In addition to providing the defined protocol methods and attributes, subscripting
   the instance is equivalent to calling the :meth:`!get` method.

Every `Distribution Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_
includes some metadata, which you can extract using the :func:`!metadata` function::

    >>> wheel_metadata = metadata('wheel')  # doctest: +SKIP

The keys of the returned data structure name the metadata keywords, and
the values are returned unparsed from the distribution metadata::

    >>> wheel_metadata['Requires-Python']  # doctest: +SKIP
    '>=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*'

:class:`PackageMetadata` also presents a :attr:`!json` attribute that returns
all the metadata in a JSON-compatible form per :PEP:`566`::

    >>> wheel_metadata.json['requires_python']
    '>=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*'

The full set of available metadata is not described here.
See the PyPA `Core metadata specification <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#core-metadata>`_ for additional details.

.. versionchanged:: 3.10
   The ``Description`` is now included in the metadata when presented
   through the payload. Line continuation characters have been removed.

   The ``json`` attribute was added.


.. _version:

Distribution versions
---------------------

.. function:: version(distribution_name)

   Return the installed distribution package version for the named
   distribution package.

   Raises :exc:`PackageNotFoundError` if the named distribution
   package is not installed in the current Python environment.

The :func:`!version` function is the quickest way to get a
`Distribution Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_'s version
number, as a string::

    >>> version('wheel')  # doctest: +SKIP
    '0.32.3'


.. _files:

Distribution files
------------------

.. function:: files(distribution_name)

   Return the full set of files contained within the named
   distribution package.

   Raises :exc:`PackageNotFoundError` if the named distribution
   package is not installed in the current Python environment.

   Returns :const:`None` if the distribution is found but the installation
   database records reporting the files associated with the distribuion package
   are missing.

.. class:: PackagePath

    A :class:`pathlib.PurePath` derived object with additional ``dist``,
    ``size``, and ``hash`` properties corresponding to the distribution
    package's installation metadata for that file.

The :func:`!files` function takes a
`Distribution Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_
name and returns all of the files installed by this distribution. Each file is reported
as a :class:`PackagePath` instance. For example::

    >>> util = [p for p in files('wheel') if 'util.py' in str(p)][0]  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> util  # doctest: +SKIP
    PackagePath('wheel/util.py')
    >>> util.size  # doctest: +SKIP
    859
    >>> util.dist  # doctest: +SKIP
    <importlib.metadata._hooks.PathDistribution object at 0x101e0cef0>
    >>> util.hash  # doctest: +SKIP
    <FileHash mode: sha256 value: bYkw5oMccfazVCoYQwKkkemoVyMAFoR34mmKBx8R1NI>

Once you have the file, you can also read its contents::

    >>> print(util.read_text())  # doctest: +SKIP
    import base64
    import sys
    ...
    def as_bytes(s):
        if isinstance(s, text_type):
            return s.encode('utf-8')
